Li 1 Kailun Li Instructor Jenifer Paquette ENC 1101 5 March 2017 global sea-level upward trend is continuing to grow sea-level rise is a long-standing concern, as the trend of global warming is slow, the effects of global warming will appear in decades later (KJE, 2004). However, the trend of global climate change in recent years is continuing to increase. And the sea-level rising is one of the most significant problems of climate changing. As early as the beginning of the twenty-first century, the upward trend in sea level rising has been remaining at a low speed. But due to the environmental pollution caused by the intensification of human activities such as industrial pollution and greenhouse gas emission, the rate at which the sea level continues to rise is growing rapidly in the next few years (Maric, 2016)) Therefore, human habitation, especially in coastal areas, will be affected by sea-level rising. The sharp rising in sea level has forced people to face up to global climate change issues, a series of urban planning is also summarized by the governments as a difficult problem because of the rapid increase in sea level (KJE, 2004). In fact, with the passage of time, the rapid acceleration of global climate change has led to an increase in sea level rising. Sea level rising and global climate change has a direct relationship, the main reason for global climate is due to the intensification of human activities. In recent years, severe climate change has led to accelerated sea-level rising. According to Hansen, suggest that over the next 100 years, a rise of between 1.4 and 5.8 might be expected in average near-surface temperatures, bringing a range of associated changes Li 2 including the increase in sea level and alterations in patterns of precipitation and storm (2010). The change in global climate can lead to an increase in precipitation, the main reason for the rise in sea level is the result of global warming. In addition, with the increasing of near- surface temperatures, two-level glacier melting is also one of the main reasons for the rising in sea level (KJE, 2004). Therefore, the increase in global climate change will directly affect the rate of sea-level rising. The authors Maciopinto and Liso state out that 2000 to 2014, The best fit of measurements shows an increasing rate of sea-level rising ranging from 4.4 mm/y to 8.8 mm/y, which will result in a maximum sea-level rising of approximately 2 m during the 22nd century (2016). The rate of sea-level rising rises from 4.4 millimeters per year to 8.8 millimeters per year, this means that in the Twenty-second Century the living environment of port cities must higher 2 meters than current. The huge environmental change will force people to change their living environment. Furthermore, the dramatic rising in sea level in recent years has also led people to look for ways to slow the global climate change. Human activity is the main cause of recent global changes. Hansen points out that is over 90% probability that global warming is primarily caused by human due to greenhouse gas (2010). With the increase in consumption levels, more and more urban vehicles are in the city. The more human demand, the more manufacturing in the factory, the factory work emissions of gas and automobile exhaust are the basics of the greenhouse effect. According to Hansen, European Environment Agency the annual average temperature for the European land area up to 2008 was 1.2 above pre-industrial (2010). Moreover, the other example provided by Maric et al is that values of night time urban air temperatures during the summer are several degrees centigrade higher compared to the surrounding (2016). The cause of global climate change is excessive emissions and Li 3 manufacturing. On the other hand, with the sea level rising rate is increasing, Local governments face several issues when considering the city planning for sea level rising. The direct example is written by KJE et al in the article using sea level rise projections for Urban Planning in Australia. Australia as a representative port city received an investigation of sea level rise. Due to human pollution and gas emissions, the sea level rise to accelerate the need to make local governments to consider the re-planning for the future living environment. With the acceleration of global warming, the rate of sea level rising has also accelerated because of the human industry emissions and waste of resources. Global climate change and sea level rising have been changing from the past to the present, all the scholarly articles have mentioned this point. The only different is that this rate of change of sea level rising has changed significantly in recent years, especially 2000-2014. (2016). Therefore, measures taken by mankind to cope with the accelerated rate of sea level rising are also changing. Li 4 Work cited Masciopinto, Costantino and Isabella Serena Liso.
