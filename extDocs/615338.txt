Brooke Doran Professor Townsend ENC 1102 Project 1 Intermediate Draft 29 January 2017 Physician Assisted Dying: Right or Wrong? In a few states across the United States it is legal for physicians and patients to participate in the practice of physician assisted dying. There are regulations that vary state to state on assisted suicide, but in general in order for someone to participate in it they must be at least 18, be a legal resident of that particular state, are told by a doctor that they are only expended to live for 6 months or less, and must request assisted suicide two times verbally along with one written request (PROCON,2017). Patients with terminal illnesses have taken advantage of this option in order to not suffer from their illness, many people disagree with this even being a legal option for people. Patients with terminal illnesses end up doing this for many reasons, a few being that they want to have to endure the pain of their terminal illness, and want their last days to be filled with pain and in a hospital or nursing home bed. Many people when they take this medication take it at their home before they got to bed and painlessly pass away in their sleep (DEATHWITHDIGNITY,2017). The people who disagree with this choice do not want people thinking they should just die rather than enduring the illness and surviving. Being informed on the opinions of both people who agree and disagree with the practice of physician assisted suicide, can help make a possible resolutions for two organizations that are at odds with each other. Death with Dignity Political Fund is an organization that is actively trying to pass legislature to make physician assisted suicide legal in many states in the United States. (DEATHWITHDIGNITY,2017) Death with Dignity National Center is an organization that Death with Dignity laws and information, education, and support about Death with Dignity as an end-of-life option to patients, family members, legislators, advocates, healthcare and end-of-life care professionals, media, and the interested (DEATHWITHDIGNITY,2017) The Death with Dignity Political Fund and National Center work hand and hand to help each other achieve their goals in the aspect of physician assisted suicide, by educating the public, passing legislature, and raising funds (DEATHWITHDIGNITY,2017). These organizations want people to feel like they have the freedom make their own end-of-life decisions, including how they DEATHWITHDIGNITY,2017). People usually fear the unexpected and making this be an option can make patients feel comforted to know that they know when it will all end: they now can expect when they with die, so there would be no unknown. Another option stated on the Death with Dignity website is for people that want assisted suicide, but for any number of reasons should refuse to eat or drink as an alternative to assisted suicide. A study was done by sending out a questionnaire to nurses and social workers that are in hospice programs to see how they felt on patients receiving assisted suicide and participating in refuse all food and (TA,2014) This study concluded that the hospice workers supported people who chose to participate in voluntary refusal of all food and fluids rather than those who chose to do assisted suicide (TA,2004). Death with Dignity would rather patients to do assisted suicide because it would cause less suffering than refusing food and fluids. Not Dead Yet a national, grassroots disability rights group that opposes the legalization of assisted suicide and euthanasia as deadly forms of (NOTDEADYET,2014) This group believes that physicians prescribe the assisted suicide medication to people who are not terminally ill, want it, and they also do not the cause of the suffering or whether it can be (NOTDEADYET,2014) This being said the organization believes physicians are breaking the law and abusing their power as a physician. They also believe that doctors will and do quality of this shows that people who may have assisted suicide presented to them as a medical option may not legally be allowed to do this procedure (NOTDEADYET,2014). Elder abuse is another issue that concerns this organization (NOTDEADYET,2014). They believe that some elders with illnesses that impair them may be into choosing assisted (NOTDEADYET,2014). This is also illegal, this option should be decided by the patient and no one should be pushing them into it. This organization believes that the elderly are pushed to make this decision because people view their life is worth less and that they are a nuisance (NOTDEADYET,2014). A study was done to see if it could be proven that groups were abused in physician assisted suicide. It concluded that there was no way to prove this is an issue, but there was no way to completely prove what it not happening. (BATTIN,2007) This is a valid concern being that the people involved may not be able to speak up against this injustice being that they may be disabled, unable to speak, or people may not believe them. Both of these organizations have valid points and reasonable opinions, but there must be someway to make a compromise between these two organizations. Some common ground between these organizations is that they both want patients to be relieved of pain and suffering; however they believe in different ways of accomplishing this. No matter their beliefs, physician assisted suicide is legal in six states in the U.S., this makes it difficult for Not Dead Yet to fight the legislature (PROCON,2017). A way for Not Dead Yet to be more accepting of the legislature already in place is to partially change it or to add restrictions of who and why they are allowed to get this assisted suicide medication. Making a board of palliative doctors who are the only people who are allowed to decide if assisted suicide can be considered as an option for a certain patient. Having a board of doctors for the sole purpose of deciding who can receive assisted suicide would eliminate the possibility of doctors imposing their own beliefs onto a patient. The decision would to be unanimous between all of the doctors on the board and be based on previously decided strict guidelines regarding the illness, the severity of it, their life expectancy, and how many of the doctors agree with prescribing them the assisted suicide medication. This would be a good compromise for both Death with Dignity and Not Dead yet. A scholarly article tried to tie physician assisted care into palliative care, but concluded that the definition of palliative care restricted these physicians them from participating physician assisted suicide (JME,2017) Even though they be doing participating in the practice of physician assisted suicide because part of the definition of palliative care is to hasten or postpone they are still informed enough through the experiences they acquired through their career to make the decision of who should be able to or not (JME,2017). If Not Dead Yet is still not okay with this compromise then they can continue and expand their education program. If Death with Dignity is not okay with this compromise then they can do their best in continuing educating and help people who want to have assisted suicide to go through the process of getting approved to do so.
