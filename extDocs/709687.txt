Running head: ALTERNATIVE FOR THE FLU VACCINE 1 An Alternative for the Existing Flu Vaccine Cristina V. Shawver U30946798 University of South Florida Running head: ALTERNATIVE FOR THE FLU VACCINE 2 Influenza, commonly referred to as the flu, is a respiratory infection characterized by several uncomfortable symptoms such as body aches, chills, cough, fever, headaches, and sore throat (Medline Plus, 2017). To combat risk of acquiring the flu, most individuals receive the flu vaccine, but researched the contents or effectiveness of the vaccine. While the advertisements on TV show that the vaccine is a great option to prevent the flu, most have any knowledge about the vaccine. What most people are unaware of is that there are many harmful ingredients used to make the vaccine such as formaldehyde, monosodium glutamate (MSG) and mercury. Also, the flu vaccine is not always effective to prevent the flu virus as the effectiveness of the vaccine can be altered during its creation. Rather than continuing to use these vaccines and ignoring their potential risks, an alternative to this vaccine must be created. To make this new vaccine a reality, sign the petition on change.org so legislation may be proposed to create a new vaccine with natural, more effective ingredients. As stated, influenza comes with a variety of symptoms which stem from a respiratory infection. Each flu season, a new vaccine must be adapted to fit the strain of virus that spreads for that year. While the flu vaccine is a popular preventer of the flu, the ingredients inside seem to raise question. The flu vaccine is created from egg embryos combined with the specific strain of virus to ensure that the virus is stopped (National Vaccination Information Center). seem too harmful right? What mentioned by most doctors, is that the vaccine contains much more than that. According to the NVIC, the flu vaccine contains other ingredients such as monosodium glutamate (MSG), formaldehyde, and thimerosal (a form of mercury). MSG is an additive, most commonly found in foods, known for causing various symptoms such as headaches, chest pain, and nausea (Mayo Clinic, 2017). According to their safety data sheets, formaldehyde and thimerosal can be toxic to the kidneys, liver, spleen, bone marrow, and central Running head: ALTERNATIVE FOR THE FLU VACCINE 3 nervous system (MSDS). As seen, MSG, formaldehyde, and thimerosal are all substances that should not be included in vaccines because they can have harmful effects on the body. Understanding the harm that the chemicals inside the vaccine can have on the body affirms that this vaccine should be created with more natural, less harmful ingredients. Do you really want those chemicals inside you and your body? Another fact that most individuals aware of is the flu vaccine can become ineffective through mutations during its creation. This means, the vaccine can become ineffective while it is being made. According to a study researching the effectiveness of the 2013 flu vaccine, the vaccine became ineffective as they, that it because of something happening in nature, but rather something in manufacturing [that caused the It was actually at the vaccine candidate virus stage, the egg-adapted stage, that those mutations in the vaccine virus were  (Roos, 2014). Due to the mutation, the vaccine had reduced effectiveness during the 2013 flu season. Although it always known how effective the shot will be until after many patients take it, important that the parents can be sure whether or not their family will be protected from the flu. This points towards the need for a new, and more effective vaccine that will protect families and loved ones from receiving the horrible symptoms of the flu. Knowing that the ingredients inside the flu shot healthy for the body and the shot always effective, why do families continue to be vaccinated? This question can be answered through another study which asked 500 participants what influenced their flu-shot decisions for their children (Flood, 2010). They found that 95% decided to vaccinate their families for prevention of influenza and 89% vaccinated due to doctor recommendation. Many parents desire to keep their children free of the flu virus, but are blind to facts about the flu vaccine. Running head: ALTERNATIVE FOR THE FLU VACCINE 4 Specifically, most are unaware of the chemicals that are put inside your body when you decide to take the flu vaccine. Beyond that, combining the chemicals inside with the truth that the vaccine can be ineffective makes it seem like more of a risk than protection. What if there was a better option, a new vaccine? Flu vaccines have been given to the public for years, but most people are unaware that these vaccines have harmful ingredients and may be ineffective even before administered to the public. Rather than continuing to receive this vaccine knowing its flaws, the public should take action. A great solution to the problem is that a new vaccine must be created that not only better treats the flu virus, but also is made with more natural ingredients. To help further the proposition of this new natural flu vaccine, join me and sign the petition on change.org. The petition outlines the pros of this new vaccine and why the public will benefit from it. If enough supporters sign, a change can be made to better the flu vaccination for everyone. Not only will you protect your own family, but the generations after you will see healthier flu seasons for their children. Also, the government will see that the people care about this subject and are willing to take action to ensure a new flu vaccine is made. Taking this one small step of signing the petition can lead to a much larger change, the creation of better flu vaccines and healthier people.
