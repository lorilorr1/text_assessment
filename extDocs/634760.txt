Guseinova 1 Vafa Guseinova ENC 1102 Andrew DeCarion January 29, 2017 Privacy in the United States In the 21th century, terrorism is a big comprehensive problem that affects many countries. This problem is a specific phenomenon of second half of the 20-21 century. Terrorism is a method or a cult of violence that is based on the ideological reasons used in a way to achieve certain goals. Terrorism usually is used by some organized groups or political parties. The main goal of terrorist attacks are pains and suffers to as many people as possible. This phenomenon has spread throughout the world. Today, terrorism is happening even in the most developed countries. The common things that can be destroyed by terrorism are security threat of ordinary humans, the stability of the government system, economic development, and also safety of democracy. Terrorism is global problem. So, we are never sure that we all will not be affected by this cult of violence. Terror began to affect the global economy, and there is serious issue in every country that start fighting against this phenomenon. In the US, one of the organizations, the National Security Agency (NSA), is the US government agency that engaged in intercepting and decrypting messages, as well as communication control of citizens. In contrast, the Stand Against Spying (SAS) is coalition of organizations and individuals from across the political spectrum advocating for transparency and the end to the mass observations (SAS n.p.). The NSA and the SAS are the US organizations that represent national privacy and safety for the local citizens. Therefore, both organizations should agree to collaborate with one another to establish democracy in the country and at the same time, safety for the US citizens from terror attacks. Guseinova 2 The National Security Agency is responsible for collecting and analyzing Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) information. The NSA has rights to collect metadata about the phone calls of Americans. For the NSA, national security is an important issue. After September 11 in 2002, the 43d President George W. Bush authorized the program of monitoring the electronic communications (including the control of e-mail messages, phone calls, financial transactions and internet activity). In September 11, 2002, many innocent people became victims of terror attack. That day was hard to go through for the whole country and for the whole world. This attack made all world realize that we are all potential victims. Among the dead people on that day, there were people of different nationalities whose only fault was that they were peaceful citizens of free society. This terror attack has become a threat to global scale. The state is trying to deal or prevent this problem, by creating various organizations such as the NSA to combat terrorism. That is why the NSA is listening to only the US phone calls, messages and emails. According to Beaudette and Major, NSA only obtains communications meeting statutory requirements; it cannot, for example, acquire every email from a given (32). The NSA does not invade in privacy of people who are citizens of other countries; it makes the NSA more reliable and trustworthy. The Stand Against Spying (SAS) is coalitions of organization that support freedom and democracy. Every individual has rights to live. This is the most generally accepted, natural and inalienable human right, the essence of which is that no one shall be arbitrarily spy of his or her life. In addition to rights to live, all people deserve right to human dignity, liberty and security of person. The right to human dignity is the duty of the state, its agencies and other citizens comply with the law and ethical standards in the relationship with every person, be legal, respectful, not to violate its actions its rights and freedoms. The SAS maintains that spying of millions the US Guseinova 3 people violates the US Constitution and international law. Also, collecting records of communications through phone call, messages, or Internet, paints an intimate portrait of people lives. These types of surveillance trample privacy, democracy and chill freedom of speech. The SAS say, believe that democracy and freedom thrive when Constitutional values and human rights are upheld. We believe all people, regardless of nationality, have a basic right to privacy and freedom of (SAS n.p.). The SAS stands for civil liberties and government transparency in democracy country. The SAS against committed to ending mass spying of the US citizens. The NSA and SAS have not come to a resolution yet because they represent different missions and different goals. Building upon this common ground both organizations the NSA and the SAS could benefit from a some compromise. Their perspectives cover the national safety and democracy of the US. The representatives are the US government and Congress which finds national safety an essential issue. They are trying to avoid crime and terrorism by giving citizens peaceful life. However, the SAS maintains that the NSA is exploiting to invade the US privacy. The representatives are the US citizens. The US citizens stand for the idea that they want to live without fear that somebody is spying of the people. The US citizens say that spying is contrary to freedom and democracy. According to the SAS, has not passed legislation to stop the mass surveillance or even to bring new levels of transparency to the surveillance (SAS n.p.). The SAS supports the democracy and an idea that government should follow what the people want. So, even though these two stakeholders that represent different groups of people and they have different motivations, goals they both prospects are national freedom and safety.
