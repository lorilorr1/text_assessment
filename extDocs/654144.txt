Overall legally there is a law established to protect discrimination of sexes for employers but Janssen digs in deeper to reveal that although the law does have to be addressed by employers it is not necessarily being reinforced. Employers can bias the hiring and payroll process on their own which is what Janssen goes on to explain. Employers bias employees based on their own social merit to their liking leading to a discriminatory attitude. Considering several higher paying jobs are run by males, whom in term may have a social Otero 3 attitude in believing that a male is more fulfilling for a certain job, this can bias the ability of a woman to receive honorable pay for her work in comparison to a male.
