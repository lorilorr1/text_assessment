Buschle 1 Charlie Buschle ENC1101 March 2, 2017 Project 2 Intermediate Draft In the world today, sports remain at the forefront of American popular culture, with no sport being more popular than the National Football League. The NFL is a billion dollar industry that makes is name off of Hail Mary touchdowns, one handed catches, and earth shattering hits. We look up to these teams and their players as if they are indestructible, larger than life superheroes. Because of this, we fail to recognize the effects the game has on these players long term health. Of these effects, the most concerning is the games effect on the brain, more specifically, concussions. This report will analyze the long term effect of concussions on both active and retired NFL players, how concussions are perceived by both the public and the NFL, and how the conversation about the topic has changed over time. The long term effects of concussions on the brain have been thoroughly over the past 17 years. always been observed as a threat to the victim of said concussions, but over time, the threat was taken more and more seriously. In an article published by Brain Injury Canada in 2010 titled Lou disease linked to concussions, NFL players need to raise awareness  the research begins to display serious signs of some fatal possibilities. It discusses that if not properly treated, multiple concussions can eventually lead to a plethora of life threatening illnesses, one of the most dangerous being ALS, or more commonly known as Lou disease. ALS leads to muscle weakness and eventual muscle loss, impaired speech, mild cognitive impairment, and severe unintentional weight loss (Mayo Clinic). The majority of ALS cases ends in death of the patient. With studies beginning to discover major results in 2010, they Buschle 2 would only continue to discover more and more dangerous illnesses and effects of concussions on NFL players. For example in a Defense Council Journal article by Jay Barry Harris in 2016 titled Only Just Begun: Determining Who Pays after the Approval Of The NFL Concussion  the author delves deep into the effects of CTE on the brain. Traumatic Encephalophy (CTE) was is linked to the list of possible long term effects of multiple concussions or improperly treated concussions. It is a progressive degenerative disease that has been found athletes who have a history of repetitive brain trauma. This trauma includes symptomatic concussions and other severe blows to the brain. The trauma triggers progressive degeneration of brain tissue. The loss of tissue can lead to an endless list of detrimental effects to the human brain, including memory loss, confusion, impaired judgement, impulse control problems, aggression, depression, and eventual dementia. As displayed in these two source examples, clear to see that the long term effects of concussions on the human brain has begun to be taken more and more seriously, as researchers and scientists continue to discover more and more life threatening effects. The perception of concussions is something that has changed quite drastically over the history of professional football. In the early days, the only thing protecting heads from the many dangers of the game was a leather cap. As time went on, helmets were introduced to better protect heads from dangerous collisions. Even then, concussions always taken as seriously as doctors today hoped. In a piece written by Daniel J. Kain in 2009 titled Just a The National Football Denial of a Causal Link between Multiple Concussions and Later-Life Cognitive  Kain describes how concussions always taken too seriously. He describes that the NFL has always profited off of the violent collisions, describing them as primary ingredient behind the incredible success of the Buschle 3 Due to these big hits, concussions became quite prevalent across the league. He goes on to say that because concussions were so common, they were often looked at as commonplace, taken lightly, and treated improperly. The perception of concussions would soon make a complete 180 degree shift as more and more long term effects would be discovered. In a 2013 article by Brad J. Reich titled When Getting Your Bell  May Lead to Ringing the : Potential Compensation For NFL Player Concussion-Related  the author describes how the conversation has become much more seriously than in previous times. The article compiles several instances of long term brain damage on former NFL players. No case was more documented than that of former San Diego Chargers linebacker Junior Seau, who committed suicide in 2012 at his home in Oceanside, California. He was 43. Many saw this case, in particular, as the one that changed the perception of concussions as we know. The news of Seau, a former hero to fans all over the world, taking his life due to illness if the brain hit too close to home for many fans along with the NFL front office, who lost one of their all-time great players. After these events, concussions were in no doubt a major threat to the health and wellbeing of NFL players, putting the league in a tough decision, as they are pressed for time to find a solution to this rapidly growing problem. As clearly displayed above, concussions are a serious issue facing the NFL because they continue to put their players lives in danger. While they always looked at as the threat they are today, the NFL has accepted concussions as a continually growing issue and need to do everything in their power to halt it.
