Liam Hemsley 1/29/17 The living conditions in Syria are unfit for any person to live, so many people are trying to flee the country for their safety. Under the current administration the United States has indefinitely closed off their borders to anyone coming from Syria. The American government could allow Syrian refugees into the country safely by increasing the intensity of background checks to ensure the people coming in are not threats to America. The people of Syria have been forced into living in what is like a never ending nightmare for the past 5 years. The war in Syria began in March, 2011 when 4 protesters were killed by security forces. This started a chain reaction of events which that led to the forces of Russia, America, the Kurds, ISIS, the Syrian government (lead by Assad), and Syrian rebels to fight amongst each other. All this fighting has caused of innocent civilians to lose their lives and millions of people to be displaced from their homes. The fighting started between the Syrian government and rebels in 2011, and after 3 years fighting started to break out between the rebel forces, which led to ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) starting to take power. Once ISIS got involved in the fighting and released a video of them beheading an American journalist, America joined in and started using airstrikes against ISIS hideouts and in the support of the Kurdish fighters, in September 2014. Nearly a year later Russia joins the fight by using air strikes on rebel forces in support of army, killing many innocent civilians in the process. Many cities got destroyed by this violence and it continues to this day. The biggest city in Syria, Aleppo, has been a main target for air strikes and continuous fighting for the past 4 years, it once had a population of 2,00,000 people but since the war most of its inhabitants have been forced to abandon their homes if they want to survive. Because the innocent people of Syria have been victimized by the war, they seek refuge in other countries so that they may live a peaceful life, free from harm. It is only human for other countries to open their borders for people that are trying to escape a place of war, where innocent adults and children are killed every day. In 2016 America only excepted 12,587 Syrians, this number should be drastically higher in order to help more people have a chance at a real life. Under the Trump administration, America has made a drastic change on how they deal with refugees from Syria. In the past America would let in refugees after they completed extensive background checks in a process that could take up to 3 years to complete, and Syrians would have to complete an even stricter test to gain admittance to the United States. But now America has suspended entrance of all refugees for 120 days, with Syrians being indefinitely banned from coming to America. This ban on refugees was created in order to protect the citizens of America from possible terrorist attacks coming from members of terrorist organizations trying to pose as refugees and get into America. United States must be vigilant during the visa-issuance process to ensure that those approved for admission do not intend to harm Americans and that they have no ties to The current administration is going to continue to be tough on making borders secure, and in doing so it will be much more difficult for Syrians to get refuge in America. The Secretary of Homeland Security is going to implement a new program for identifying possible terrorist threats implementing in- person interviews; a mechanism to ensure that the applicant is who the applicant claims to be; a process to evaluate the likelihood of becoming a positively contributing member of society; and a mechanism to assess whether or not the applicant has the intent to commit criminal or terrorist acts after entering the United One thing that both Syrian refugees and Americans want, is to be safe. Syrians are attempting to flee their home country because they can longer be safe there, while America want to admit Syrians in because they fear terrorist could sneak in with the refugees. It has been difficult for both sides to come up with a compromise that benefits both parties. The American government could continue to have extensive background checks on people coming from Syria, and could even increase the intensity of the checks, but they must remove the ban on all Syrians coming into the country. In return America will gain diversity and the people coming from Syria can contribute to society making America a better place for everyone to live in.
