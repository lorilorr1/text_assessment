Leistl 1 Brooke Leistl Professor Emil Smith Composition 1 28 February 2017 Tommy John Over Time Tommy John is an injury primarily in baseball pitchers because of the overhand throwing motion. It is also known as ulnar collateral reconstruction (UCL). It was named Tommy John after the first pitcher, had the procedure done. It is where they must replace the ligament in the elbow with a tendon from another part of your body. It is more common now to have the procedure done because there have been more cases and technology in the medical field has improved. While there has been a multitude of scholarly conversations over the past 16 years that have addressed the chances of players returning to their previous performance consistently, those chances have decreased over time. Throughout the time of 2000-2010 there has been many case studies on Tommy John. Most of the studies found that pitching performance after UCL reconstruction returns to baseline by the second season after surgery. That is if everything runs smoothly and there are no complications. (82%) pitchers returned to major league play at a mean of 18.5 months after surgery with no significant change in mean earned run average or walks and hits per inning (Gibson, 2007) This is showing that it did take a little longer to come back from the surgery but it affect their performance after the surgery. They came back to normal play. For example, the first player to receive this surgery was After his surgery, he came back and proceeded to win 164 games. In the article, it shows the reader that Leistl 2 (47%) reconstructed pitchers returned to major league play during the first post index season. Fifty (74%) reconstructed pitchers returned to major league play by the second post index season. Fifty-three (78%) reconstructed pitchers returned to major league play by the third post index season. The remaining 3 reconstructed pitchers returned to major league play greater than 3 years after the index This shows that the player will return to play, it just depends on who that person is, how bad their injury was, there body type, etc. There are always complications that come with surgery, and sometimes you can overcome them and sometimes you occurred in 148 patients (20%), including 16% considered minor and 4% considered (Cain, 2007) of 16 (63%) patients returned to the same level of play with a minimum 2-year Those six were some that could not overcome the complications, but the chances of returning are still high. In another article Cain states, collateral ligament reconstruction (1266) or repair (15) was performed in 1281 patients over a 19-year period (198822006) using a modification of the Jobe This is giving the reader information that the amount of surgeries gone up or down and is constant. From 2000-2010, studies have shown that pitchers can return to normal play on average 2 years after surgery, but there is always a chance for a complication that can stop that. Time has changed and so have studies. Studies for the surgery Tommy John has also changed. Back than it was the player could return to normal play after surgery, but now the tables have turned. According to Makhni, say that because you cannot do everything that you could do before your surgery, players performance declines with the number of strikes thrown (51.9%-49.6%), ERA (4.23-4.63), average fastball velocity (91.2-90.8), Even though those numbers seem like a small difference, in baseball those numbers are a difference between a ground ball and a homerun or a win and a loss. People would think that now the Leistl 3 chances of returning are better because of the increase in medical technology, but that the case. The author, Erickson, states that these, 148 pitchers (83%) were able to RTP in the MLB, and 177 pitchers were able to RTP in the MLB and minor league combined (97.2%), while only 5 pitchers (2.8%) were never able to RTP in either the MLB or minor According to Erickson, the chart shown in the article is that Seventeen pitchers (65%) returned to pitch at least 1 major league game, but only 11 pitchers (42%) pitched more than 10 games in 1 season. The chances of returning to play now a day are slimmer than they were between the time frame of 2000-2010. There has been a lot of change over time, whether for the better or worse. Tommy John has been for the worse, because according to these articles, the chances of coming back from surgery were better back then, then now. Even though technology has improved and doctors have had more experience, it still show with this specific surgery. To some this may seem weird and confusing but it shows in the facts that pitchers came back more normal between 2000-2010. Leistl 4 Works Cited Gibson, Brett W., et al.
