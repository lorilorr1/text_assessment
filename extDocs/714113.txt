Kirkus 1 David Kirkus TJ Murray Composition II 16 April 2017 The FDA Should Regulate Painkiller Use Each and every day people are admitted into hospitals, going to the ends of the Earth just to feel healthy, and even dying due to the US government, namely the poor regulation of opiates and other prescription drugs. There are too many people constantly suffering from this issue for it not to have been solved already. The government needs to focus on limiting the accessibility of, and replacing these harmful substances with non-addictive, natural remedies such as turmeric or marijuana. Too many people are still dying because of the misinformation accompanied by legal pharmaceutical drugs. arguably too easy to gain access to these drugs because of how prevalent they are within our culture. You have back pain, see a doctor, and within an hour he or she has written you a script for oxycodone or Percocet. The nasty affects that come with these narcotics, as well as most other prescription drugs, should and can easily be avoided so long as government funded agencies like the DEA and the FDA re-schedule and replace these Americans die every day from an opioid overdose (that includes prescription opioids and (CDC). is a natural root that is a part of the ginger family. It can help with back and joint discomfort, as well as swelling and inflammation. It can be cooked into food, brewed into tea, or even taken by (WebMD). Marijuana is yet another natural ailment to pain and discomfort. Many claim that it is more pleasant and less invasive than professionally prescribed pain medications. With no withdrawal symptoms, whether they be Kirkus 2 physical or psychological, (DrugFoundation.org), who want to toss out their addiction- inducing pills and look into these natural ailments? Why have we been synthesizing drugs that ultimately lead us to addiction and withdrawal symptoms when we have these naturally occurring herbs at our fingertips? While the world is changing its views on medical marijuana, the larger part of this battle has yet to be fought. Doctors almost seemingly hand out these deadly prescription medications, but why? If these drugs can be fatal, then why they illegal along with all the other fatal drugs? Narcotics are a big business, and create a ton of revenue from the sick people that prescribed to. These drugs may solve the initial problem, but they also create their own problem which is much harder to cure. For instance, taking these pills may rid a person of their back or joint pain after a few days of use. Afterwards, the body will have trouble functioning without these pills and the pain will return, only this time in a much more severe way. The pharmaceutical companies see potential profit in these patients because they will keep coming back for more pills. As a business model, this strategy is genius. Morally, this practice is wrong and should be eliminated. U.S. consumes 99% of the hydrocodone and over 80% of the (Lighthouse Recovery Institute). If the FDA pushed to change legislation in favor of medical cannabis, as well as the limitation of narcotic drug prescription, fewer people would die and the U.S. population as a whole would be healthier. It is important that we as United States citizens tackle this issue head-on and confront our government officials about the matter immediately. Nothing will get done unless the majority of the American population is on the same page, and we must all do our part in making that change if we wish for it to be accomplished. If you would like to see change in the way we deal with illness or pain in pharmacies, please take the time to contact your congressman and senator. If Kirkus 3 you do not know who your congressman and/or senator is, go to http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/ in order to locate them. It is important that this issue be resolved before it persists beyond repair. More and more people are losing their lives to drugs each year, and we can prevent it from continuing. In conclusion, there are many more soothing, natural ailments to pain and discomfort that are not being taken advantage of. The United States government must change its policies before any change can truly be made, therefore individual agencies such as the DEA and the FDA must step in and propose a change in legislation. Once that is done on a more prominent level, the remainder of the transition would come naturally. Each individual that feels passionately about this problem should must voice their opinion so that these agencies see what changes really need to be made.
