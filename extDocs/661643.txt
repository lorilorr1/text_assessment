In the last ten years, social media has taken over the world and people become using it in different aspects for different aims from purely socializing. This helps to increase the number of social media users around the world and make it as a most needed thing in daily life. Large numbers of people are logging online and spend a long time on without doing anything else except socializing. People who do that everyday scientists call them addict people. When people lose a day in only posting on SMP this is a big psychological problem that may bring issues in your life. Facebook is one of SMP that has many and many users from different nations of the world. Many anti-social media addiction organizations trying aware people about the danger of being addict by creating photos that have rhetorical appeals, Pathos, Logos, and Kairos. Facebook is an American for-profit online social media. The purpose is connecting individuals everywhere throughout the world, making the Earth a worldwide town. Mark Zuckerberg and his friends were launched this monster platform in 2004. The site mostly goes for interfacing individuals or helps them mingle and makes its income Al Ibrahim 2 out of publicizing. This website allows people post status updates, share digital photos and videos, share links, and exchange messages. Also, it enables people to join common interest user group, so allow them to meet close friends and people from work or people who have same hobbies. Due to the value data that every profile carries, Facebook gives users the choice to block people and make their profile private.

In the first image the creator successes in sending emotions to the audience in very effective way. The image shows a woman who is giving a birth. Giving a birth usually considers as a happiest moment for every woman and many consider it as the most important moment ever. While in this image the woman is caring about updating her status in Facebook to share her status online instead of looking to her birth. The literal use of this situation is made to make the point that says Facebook and social media in general has brought people addiction in using them all the time. The scenario of this image may make most audience get shocked. This may help to aware people about the addiction that most people are facing at this time.

The women is asking about the sex of the birth for only posting it on her status and share it with her friends. This represents how she becomes addicted because she forgets everything about motherhood and being responsible for her or him. In the second image the man chose to not follow the logic road, which is water. But he chose Internet, which is the wrong thing that no one would do. Both images are very persuading for people by providing sensitive situations. Kairos is the way that a photo evokes time. Kairos is very rare to find in images because creators do not usually use time. They use time only for shopping or advertising aims. In the first image the creator used time by making the woman ask the doctor for the sex to update her status as fast as she can. She wants to share the status in very quick way, which refers to the time. The second image does not really have Karios. Large number of people sees social media as helpful factor because it helps them be connected with friends, families, and people.
