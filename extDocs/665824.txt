Putting A Band-Aid On A Bullet Wound: Why Gun Legislation Targeting Individuals With Mental Illness  Journal Of Health Care AL RAWAHI 3 Law & Policy 17.2 (2014): 303-327. OmniFile Full Text Mega (H.W. Wilson). Web. 30 Jan. 2017. The writer talks about the relationship between gun violence that happened in the past few years in the United States where the shooters had legally purchased a firearm from the gun shop and they had the background check and passed it, he also talks about how people who are suffering from mental illness are usually not violence. And he explains why it easy for people with mental illness to do so. One of the reasons people who are suffering from mental illness can buy firearms and pass the background check easily is because the states are not required to report the information to the agencies that are doing the background checks. Even if they reported to the agencies, there is no standard information that they give. Furthermore, he also mentions that studies have shown that individuals who are mentally ill are not more violence than the other people, and in fact, only 4% of the violence that is happing in the United States is because of mentally ill individuals. And he tells stories about families, and how they found out how to deal with their mental illness and with the hallucinations that they may have. The author is Lindsay Bramble and the source of the article is from Journal of Health Care Law & Policy.

And how we have to worry about the issue and not mental illness because people who are suffering from mental illness are not the cause of the crime, therefore we have to put the spotlight on the bigger problem, which are guns.
