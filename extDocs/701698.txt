GINGA Started as a source of survival now a method of art. Today Ginga is known in the name of capoeira, usually known for its moves in dance or game but very few know about the evolution of capoeira.Today the name of ginga or capoeira only pops up in movies and video games, capoeira as exercise and respectable instruction is increasingly available across the world and away from major urban centers.Although it has changed during the years, the two main formats still existing are Angola and Regional styles.The angola method is a process of self-knowledge that is not limited to physical activity, whereas Regional method is characterized with more acrobatic moves and It is much faster and aggressive.It is the dance of nature, its reconnects them with the spirit of their ancestors and the energy of their mother earth. The birth of ginga was in Brazil, it was a hope for the african slaves in Brazil to escape from all the brutality they were facing from the colonists.Its origins may go back as far as the 16th century, when slaves were brought to Brazil by the colonists from central africa.The colonists did not at all treat the slaves as human, hence the slaves had to go through a lot of brutality.There was a time when all the slaves united and tried to fight back against the colonists, where their only weapon was their ginga.Although ginga was a unique and influential method of fighting but they were no match against the heavily armed colonists.After losing against the colonists things got much worse, at a moment they thought dying would be better option compared to being a slave.This period is said to be the worst time the Afro-Brazilians faced in their entire history.A lot of slaves died and others were forced to face the brutality by the colonists.Ginga again played a major role in this time, instead of fighting, they used their ginga to escape this inhumanity from the colonists. Due to city growth, more slaves were brought to cities and the increase in social life in the cities made capoeira more prominent and allowed it to be taught and practiced among more people. Because capoeira was often used against the colonial guard, in Rio the colonial government tried to suppress it and established severe physical punishments to its practice.But things took a different turn in the mid of 19th century. Slavery was at its verge as the great Portuguese rule ended in Brazil. Being the last country in the western world in 1888 Brazil finally abolished slavery.However, free former slaves now felt abandoned. Most of them had nowhere to live, no jobs and were despised by Brazilian society, which usually viewed them as lazy workers.Also, new immigration from Europe and Asia left most former slaves with no employment.The end of slavery brought about a darker era for ginga, it was being used for criminal purposes.The huge free Afro-Brazilian population saw illegality as the only source to feed themselves.Soon just in 2 years Ginga or capoeira as known today was abolished from Brazil.Anyone practicing ginga were taken under the law sometimes sentenced to death.But things changed as time went by, today ginga exists in the form dance, sport and also as a martial art.Today it is the cultural icon of Brazil, and is widely practiced all over the world.
