Student 1 Student ENC 1101 Ms. Paquette Intermediate Draft 5 March 2017 Obesity: Control your weight, Control your health Obesity is a growing epidemic in America affecting over 35% of U.S adults and 17% of children and teenagers in the United States. According to the American Medical Association (AMA), three criterion are used to define an individual as An impairment of the normal function of the human body, visual signs and symptoms and harm to oneself. In world the media, food markets, and new technology make it the cultural norm to eat excessive amounts of food not solely for nourishment, but also for pleasure. Some people may not view obesity in itself as a disease but more of a precursor to other diseases such as Anorexia, Bulimia, and overeating or However, this is not the case as obesity can lead to problems with a daily activities, even if that person claims that obesity does not affect their life whatsoever. The obesity epidemic is killing hundreds of thousands of Americans each year and it should be able to be easily prevented by following simple measures. With my research I am hoping to find simple ways to help the increased population suffering from obesity to be saved and freed from this dangerous condition. Student 2 Ever since the middle ages, when obesity was considered gluttonous, the negative connotation towards obesity was carried on to modern times. If obese people succumbed to an hour of exercise a day, although it may not be as easy as it sounds, the condition can be greatly improved or even cured. A healthy body is very important to have and should be maintained with a healthy diet and healthy exercise to prevent obesity from occurring. As we as a society become more modernized, we struggle with the questions of whether or not to define obesity as a disease or rather just low self-control. The pathology of obesity lies in its enlarged fat cells and the pathophysiology lies in the changes in the secretion of products from said enlarged fat cells. These secretions and increased fat mass are responsible for various diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and many other harmful diseases. Historically, obesity has been a problem for many people as well as a threat to the health and safety of citizens of the United States. Several life threatening diseases are derived from obesity such as heart disease, hypertension, stroke, cancer, diabetes, mellitus, gallbladder disease, dyslipidemia, osteoarthritis, gout and sleep apnoea (WHO, 1). This makes obesity even more hazardous to oneself since it comes along with other very serious diseases. On another note, the social implications that obesity can cause is prejudice; because of this, obese individuals may not want to seek medical assistance due to the social backlash that they believe it may cause. The World Health Organization (WHO) created a type of database on obesity, researching epidemiological information, contributing factors to obesity and the consequences that come with the disease (WHO, 2). The defined individuals as obese by observing the body mass index. Body mass index (BMI) is calculated by taking a weight over their height squared. For example, an individual with a height of that weighs Student 3 125 pounds; The BMI would be calculated by multiplying weight (lbs) by .45 resulting in a bmi of 22.1. A BMI is in essence an attempt to quantify the amount of muscle, fat and bone mass in a person, then categorizing that individual as obese, normal, or underweight (WHO, 4). is the second leading cause of preventable death with over 300,000 U.S citizens a year being victimized by this The fact that it is the second leading cause of death in the United States should be enough call for concern within the society. The fact that it is a preventable death means it is very important to spread awareness into how to prevent the condition from occurring. The ability to maintain a healthy diet is very important to keeping oneself at a healthy medium as well and mainiting a and daily exercise routine. People should know that exercise is a very important factor that can drastically improves a health. Physical exercise is another crucial role in maintaining a healthy body. There are a variety of options and programs that the community which can encourage U.S citizens to get active. The General has published a program resource guide that provides information about several health benefits of walking and how programs such as Mall Walking can help people become more active. This is very important for people to know and see how preventable obesity really is and for others to see that there is still hope to end obesity within themselves.
