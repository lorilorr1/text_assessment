Running head: Benefits of GM Food 1 Project 1: Benefits of GM food on health Smirnou Stanislau University of South Florida Benefits of GM Food 2 Project 1: Benefits of GM food on health Food is one of the most important factors for survival of living organisms and humans are not exceptions. Throughout the history people were trying to improve and modify their food sources. According to archeological and paleontological evidence, first cultivation of plants occurred in southern Levant around 11,000 B.P., while first domestication of animals took place 1,000 years later (Zeder, 2008). Since that time, methods of cultivation were improved and hundreds or even thousands of new species were artificially selected to open new horizons for agriculture. However, with recent advancements of bioengineering techniques, methods of artificial selection can no longer compete to be primary instrument in the hands of bioengineers. Nowadays, scientists can convert years of artificial selection into weeks or even days of biological manipulations with genomes to get a desired trait of an organism. Despite a huge decrease in time needed for production of new organisms or traits, scientists can avoid undesired changes of other parts of the genome that occur during artificial selection. Also, genetic modification techniques provide a huge field for potential treatment of human diseases. However, despite all advantages that GM provides for health, there are still huge proportions of populations of different countries that believe that genetic modification is dangerous. As a molecular biologist doing research in proteins and their structures, investigating how induced mutations can modify structure of proteins such as COR 15 A which is a potential candidate to be inserted in plants to make them cold-resistant and p-53 that is one of the main tumor-suppressor proteins, I would like to focus on benefits that GM can provide for health. Therefore, in this essay I will show practical implications of genetic modifications (GM) that improves health.

Science, (5451). 303. Article the Provitamin A Biosynthetic Patway into (Carotenoid-Free) Rice summarizes a common situation that occurs in some parts of the world were deficiency of vitamin A (VAD) occurs due to lack of pre-vitamin A in the food and provides a solution to that problem. VAD leads to a variety of heath problems including conditions from night blindness to the complete blindness, diarrhea, respiratory disease and as a result causes a quarter of a million people only in Southeast Asia to go blind each year. Authors estimated that around 124 million children worldwide have VAD and propose a solution to that problem by genetic modification of the most common source of food in those places - rice. The article is relevant to the topic, because it provides example of the benefits for human health after implication of methods of genetic engineering. Ligation of bacterial version of gene that can catalyze production of from its precursor helps to enrich rice with provitamin A and provides a source of Vitamin A for people who are suffering from VAD.

Journal Of Clinical Investigation, 124(8), 3391-3406. doi:10.1172 JCI72517 Article of therapeutically modified bacteria into gut microbiota inhibits summarizes results of the study that proposes potential way to decrease obesity in humans by incorporation of genetically modified bacteria that produces therapeutic factors into gut. Obesity is a rising problem in many countries and developing therapeutic techniques to treat that condition is a cornerstone in prevention of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancer. Susceptibility to obesity is contributed by microbiota of the gut and thus, modification of microbiota can open new ways in therapeutics of obesity. In mice introduction of bacteria that secretes the N-acylphosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs) molecules that are then converted into class of lipids that can reduce obesity level when animals are on a high-fat diet. NAPEs are direct precursors of N-acylethanolamide (NAE) lipids that increase sensitivity to the the adipose- derived negative feedback signal molecules such as leptin. That article is relevant to the topic, because it provides a good quality data that shows potential benefit of genetical modification of bacteria on treatment of obesity. Article was published in the reliable peer reviewed journal and authors have declared no conflict of interest. That research was done by scientists who had many publications on the similar topic in peer reviewed journals. They work in Vanderbilt University obesity and lipids.

Enrichment of tomato fruit with health-promoting anthocyanins by expression of select transcription factors. Nature Biotechnology, (11), 1301. Article of tomato fruit with health-promoting anthocyanins by expression of select transcription describes the study conducted to investigate effect of introduction of anthocyanins molecules into tomato fruit on heath. Anthocyanins are class of polyphenols that exist in many products that are part of a human natural diet. Previous studies have revealed a positive effect of those molecules on health in terms of protection from cancers, cardio-vascular diseases, diabetes and other dangerous conditions. Therefore, raising concentration of anthocyanin in food is a logical idea. However, to reach a positive effect, a high concentration of anthocyanin should be consumed daily. Naturally, tomato fruits contain a low level of anthocyanins and to increase their concentration some genetic modification were conducted. New GM tomato fruits with silenced DET1 gene and increased chalcone isomerase activity had up to 78-fold increase in flavanols level in fruit peel. Taking into consideration the fact that peel accounts for about 5% mass of a fruit, the total level of anthocyanins was no more than 300 micrograms per one gram of fresh weight. Further research was conducted to observe the effect that increase anthocianins concentration havs on the health of Trp53 -/- knockout mice. Those mice have a higher probability of developing cancer than other types. Results showed the increase in average life expectancy from 142.0 +- 8.7 days to 182.2 +- 8.6 days. The article is relevant to the topic of research, because it shows am example of the positives effect of GM food on human health.

Recent developments in modifying crops and agronomic practice to improve human health. Food Policy, 36(Supplement 1), S94-S101. doi: 10.1016/j.foodpol.2010.11.011 The article developments in modifying crops and agronomic practice to improve human discusses a problem of malnutrition of micronutrients in developing countries and provides possible ways to solve that problem. According to the article, one way to deal with that problem is through introduction of GM food with increased nutritional value. Deficiencies in Fe, Zn and vitamin A are among ten leading causes of diseases in developing countries. Agriculture is a primary source of macro and micronutrients for humans and genetical engineering techniques can be used to enrich food with micro-elements. Endosperm is a part of the grain that is high in nutrients, such as starch, but low in Fe and Zn which can be found their in low bioavailability due to presence of anti-nutrient phytates. Endosperm is the most valuable food for majority of people and thus, they do not consume enough micro-elements with their diets. The solution offered by the article is to reduce synthesis of phatates and to increases expression of genes responsible for accumulation of iron in endosperm. In rice endosperm, overexertion of common bean ferritin gene led to 2-3 fold increase in Fe concentration. Another factor that contributed to the accumulation of Fe was over-expression of nicotinamide synthase (NAS) gene. NAS is an important molecule that play a crucial role in iron transport.
