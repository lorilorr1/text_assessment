Bernardo Osellame Professor Carr ENC101 2 April 2017 Early Draft Tobacco usage compromises national healthcare systems, reduces the lifespans of entire population groups, and disrupts the economic output of a population by preventing individuals from reaching ages in which their usage in a service based economy would present the greatest impact. The widespread usage of tobacco in first world nations strains the national healthcare systems to a startling degree. If 80% of a population consumes it on a daily basis, a national healthcare system would need to provide cancer treatments to a large majority of a population system within 50 years of the generations inception. Unfortunately, the tax leverage required to maintain such a system would severely hamper a economic output. Either the governing body abandons national healthcare as a staple policy, or enacts the curtailing of several other branches to accommodate funds for healthcare should tax levies prove insufficient. Tobacco poses a fantastic threat to chronological development of populations. Instead of a steadily aging population developing with an eventual plateau of equal birth and death rates, high tobacco usage warps the population into a high peak of individuals within their biological peak, followed by a steady, but sharp decline in prevalence of a certain populations age group. Many nations which currently suffer from high tobacco consumption rates focus on industrial economies, where peak efficiency is the most important tool for economic output and progression. However, without a progressing middle age population base the likelihood of quickly transitioning into a service economy drops exponentially, if not being wiped out in its entirety.
