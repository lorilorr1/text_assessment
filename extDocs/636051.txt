Barr 1 Chris Barr Professor Ricketts Composition II 29 January 2017 Student athletes on college performance Participating in a sport while being a college student is not easy. If it were, everyone would be a collegiate athlete. Trying to perform well in class while also performing well in your sport at the time is very likely to cause stress. Exams, studying, tutoring, study hall and going to class plays a huge roll on being a college student but not all; running, weights, film study, and practicing that will be the athlete part of being a student athlete. Today, the demands on student athletes are much heavier than they were in the past. College was not as difficult as it is today, years ago. Completing the requirements to receive a degree was much easier and the level of competition in sports was not as high. There are many benefits and limitations to being a collegiate athlete, but how does being a student athlete affect college performance? Umbach, Paul D., Megan M. Palmer, George D. Kuh, and Stephanie J. Hannah. Intercollegiate Athletes and Effective Educational Practices: Winning Combination or Losing  SpringerLink. N.p., 22 Mar. 2006. Web. 04 Feb. 2017. In this source the authors main focus is on the way college athletes are different from the regular student body. They recommend that the athletes will not be isolated from regular students and interact with the whole student body instead of other student athletes. Barr 2 The paper also talks about how the athlete grades are lower from non-athlete but the grades are equally the same as a non-athlete. The paper also discusses the difference from athletes from non- athletes on the educational database. The schedule of student athletes is more complex than non-athletes. Student athletes have many responsibilities to account for on a day-to-day basis. The everyday life of students who participate in a sport involves class, tutoring, practice, treatment, meetings and more. However, non-athletes have at most, one major responsibility. They attend class and study to prepare for those classes. This article is relevant to my topic because the article states important facts about the difference between student athletes and non-student educational wise and bonding with the student body. The authors are creditable because they have studied at prestigious universities on the topics of educations and social interaction.

Hoffman.  Mental Well-Being and Sport Related Identities in College Students: Sociology of Sport Journal: Vol 26, No 2. N.p., June 2009. Web. 04 Feb. 2017. In this source the author focuses on the mental stage of student athletes. The article discusses how physical exercise can reduce depression. A series of test were explained throughout this article to support this fact. One of the experiments performed showed the Barr 3 probability of student athletes committing suicide. The results found this to be rare. Student athletes are less likely to be a target for suicidal thoughts than regular students. This topic is relevant to student athletes on the college performance level because they give an overview on the mental and physical stage as student athlete. The author, Kathleen Miller has research behind her claims that relate to my research question and give multiple studies on college athletes and their performance.

A Multilevel Multivariate Analysis Of Academic Performances In College Based On NCAA  Multivariate Behavioral Research 48.1 (2013): 57-95. PsycINFO. Web. 1 Feb. 2017. This article talks about student academic performance during their freshman year of college. Studies show that it is unclear whether a student GPA increases or decreases after enrolling into college. The article also talks about previous classes student athletes took in high school and how they could possibly determine the success they will have in college. Studies show that the higher the school is ranked in terms of athletics, the harder the training will be. The article then goes on to discuss how transitioning from high school to college is difficult due to the increase in the intensity of training and the amount of time needed to study. This article is relevant to my topic because the article shows data on student athletes performance their freshman year of college. The author has evidence behind his research that shows the transition from high school to college. Author Thomas Paskus, Barr 4 has a PhD in psychology and works at the national collegiate athletic association. This makes him a qualified representative to discuss collegiate student athletes.

This article is relevant to my topic because it explains the role gender plays in the success of student athletes in college. The authors provide evidence to support this claim.
