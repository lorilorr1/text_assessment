Overcrowding in the filthy factory farms also leads to severe skin and throat irritations, blindness, and deadly The chickens experience a lot of unwanted pain and torcher. There are safer ways to euthanize these chickens. One form that McDonalds should look into is CAK. This company has also dubbed the way they treat their chicken than pink If you have not read about it before McDonalds also had a problem with their chicken nuggets being called McDonalds had a huge issue on their hands with this. When people refer to pink slime their referring to mechanically separated chicken. This means pretty much that the whole chicken is grounded up. Yes, that includes the eyes nose feet etc. the meat comes out looking just like pink slime! according to Snopes separated poultry (MSP) is a paste-like and batter-like poultry product produced by forcing bones, with attached edible tissue, through a sieve or similar device under high pressure to separate bone from the edible tissue.

The rock N ad is trying to lure the younger crowd of rock stars by enticing them to rock out with French fries. This appeals to pathos. Ethos is viewed when they make you imagine that actually rocking out with French fries but in reality there really bad for you! In the second ad they are trying to lure you to buy a cheeseburger after watching the Olympics. They are appealing to the athletic crowd. These advertisements can be very tricky. They make their food look delicious but in fact very bad for you.

CAK stands for controlled atmosphere killing. according to PETA removes oxygen from the atmosphere while they are still in their transport crates. The birds are not (i.e., asphyxiated); they die from lack of oxygen, or anoxia. During this process, the oxygen from the environment is removed and slowly replaced with a nonpoisonous gas that puts the birds to sleep while they are still in their transport *(PETA) the benefits to doing CAK over other ways include the fact that the bird feel any pain. The chicken comes out fresh and un contaminated with bacteria, and less strenuous on the workers who have to kill the chickens with other means. You really need to grasp how these birds are killed when using something other than CAK. These birds are slaughtered by workers pretty much in The birds are vomiting, pooping, peeing, shedding, whaling in pain while the workers do this. This not only is horrible for the bird but can also cause injury to the employees that have to ultimately do it. When using CAK all those steps are skipped. There is no interaction between live bird and human. The birds are dead and the workers retrieve them for food production. This can solve McDonalds issue about mistreating their food livestock. In conclusion, we must take action against McDonalds. That is the main goal. has done very well in changing their ways in the past.
