In recent years, student debt across America has increased tremendously. High interest rates, large loan take-outs, and high tuition costs have caused most American students to accumulate large amounts of debt. One of the stakeholders interested in this situation is the Democratic Party, but one of its activists, One Wisconsin Now, is also highly interested in the advancement of student loan reform. According to www.onewisconsinnow.org, their objective is focused around, executing a massive public education campaign to both the media and the public about the full economic impact of the student loan debt One Wisconsin ability to create insightful ads about the student/subsidized loan problem in America and at the same time not use all visual and rhetorical appeals is effective because of their ability to combine specific elements to attract the audience to the issue about student loan debt obligations. The primary goal of One Wisconsin Now with this advertisement is to emphasize the seriousness surrounding the student loan crisis. The message being perceived in this advertisement is that student loans are so bad that they be able to pay it off before they die. There are many uses of visual rhetoric in this article. The pile of money under the graduation cap is meant to represent the accumulated debt graduates have after graduation. Another form of McKinley 2 visual rhetoric is the black quote with the word dead in the color red. This is used to emphasize the word dead, an already negatively connotative word, so that viewers can see how student loans impact the life. The quotations in this advertisement are meant to try and relate the viewer to a third person who might have said this. This is meant to make the viewer feel like they are listening to an actual human which makes it more relatable than just reading an advertisement. The target audience of this advertisement is people in Wisconsin who are or are not affected by student loan issues. The tone of the message presented is meant to be sorrowful. The quote, will be dead before paid off and no one is meant to make the intended audience feel sorry for the speaker in this advertisement, creating more sympathizers. One Wisconsin use of rhetorical appeals in this advertisement is very effective. Their ability to use all elements of rhetoric in this advertisement makes it easier to attract an audience. The use of ethos is shown in this advertisement with One Wisconsin Now. Since they are a strong pusher for democratic legislative reform for subsidized and student loans, this makes them qualified in addressing the issue.

Kairos is shown in this advertisement with the part that states, will be The intention of this message is to show the relation between the time it takes to finish paying off student loans and lifespan. This time relevancy in this statement is meant to associate the prolonged payment plans with the negative fact that it will consume most of life, which beneficial to anyone. The next advertisement that was created by One Wisconsin Now takes the argument on student loans to a more narrow prospective. In this advertisement, their objective is to bring insightful information about a specific perspective on how the student loan issue McKinley 3 should be handled. One Wisconsin Now focuses their objective on showing viewer that Senator Robert Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, has a wrong approach to handling the student loan issue.

Placing the image of Senator Johnson next to the fail hashtag creates a more effective means of negative affiliation to his position. Using the color red for the word fail and using the color blue for the word fact increases the negativity with the message under fail and for the blue it creates a sense of calmness or correctness for the message under fact. This is used to further separate the positive and negative message that is trying to be expressed in the two messages. This advertisement, like the other, consists of a fair amount of rhetorical elements in the advertisement to create an effective and attractive presentation. Ethos is used in this advertisement with One Wisconsin association to the advertisement. Their prominence in student loan reform makes them a viable source for expressing this issue. Senator Johnson has been in congress for half a decade and has a strong political standing in congress. Using a congressional member makes the credibility of this advertisement more serious because it becomes interconnected to national issues instead of local issues. Pathos is used in this advertisement with the statement, Senator Ron Johnson said like to see more for-profit This statement is intended to make the audience feel aggravated by Senator McKinley 4 position because One Wisconsin Now sees for-profit schools as a unreliable source of fixing the student loan problem, which should agitate readers and make them feel annoyed by Senator stance. Logos is shown in this advertisement with the factual statement located under the which talks about how for-profit schools charge more and have higher interest rates.

Kairos is shown in this advertisement with the hashtags and used as marking positions. Hashtags are used to show that the issue being addressed are a current issue since hashtags are a more recent form of addressing issues in a broader sense. What these two advertisements are able to do is keep the viewer focused on the student loan issue, and divert them to other political issues. Both advertisements do a good job at using visual rhetoric to emphasize the seriousness and implications of the student loan debt problem in America. Statements in these advertisements have already been seen in effect in actual legislative reformation. In Kelly 2007 article, Lawmakers Approve Landmark Increase in Student the article is centered on how democratic legislators were able to reduce spending in the private sector where for-profit schools prosper. This legislative reform was a progressive move because it reduced the chances of for-profit schools to be able to charge high tuition rates and cause more students to go into debt. One Wisconsin Now McKinley 5 addressing that issue in the second advertisement shows that what their basis is set on actually has credibility behind it. One Wisconsin effectiveness in using many aspects of visual and rhetorical sentiments in addressing the student loan crisis is what makes these advertisements so effective. Even though they are only an activist group of the Democratic Party and focus on political reform in Wisconsin, their mission is being addressed on the national level as well. With many organizations from both sides of the political spectrum addressing this issue, there may be a time in the future where a set financial system is set up for college students so that way paying for college can be affordable and practical.
