Sanson 1 Jacqueline Sanson Erika Staiger Composition II 29 th January 2017 The Treatment of Market Animals in the United States Market animals are animals used by humans for profits. This encompasses most farm animals like cows, pigs, chicken, and sheep which are raised for products like eggs, wool, and meat. Many people may imagine open fields when they imagine how these animals are raised but the industry has become increasingly industrialized leading to factory farming. (ASPCA) The quality of life these animals have, has led to opposition to the practice of farming. One group that strongly opposes the use of market animals is People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals or PETA. The organization fights for animal rights and promotes veganism as a solution to the market animal debate. This solution would not work for the United States Department of Agriculture or the USDA which regulates farming practices, including the use of market animals, and therefore promotes it. Although these two groups have vastly different views on the topic there may be a compromise. This compromise could be created by making stricter animal welfare laws when it comes to the use of market animals. The first stakeholder to discuss is the USDA and its position for the use of market animals. The USDA regulates agriculture within the country, this would include animal production. Animal production plays an important part of the United States economy and it is noted by the USDA that products account for over half of the value of U.S. agricultural products, often exceeding $100 billion per Completely getting rid of market animals in the United States would lead to a large economic hit. Along with the drastic economic change it Sanson 2 would also create a dietary change in America. Animal products, specifically meat, are common sources of protein and for many people important to their diet. It has been noted by researchers that even small amounts of meat added to a plant based diet can create large improvement on human health (van Ryssen 230). Market animals are important part of many lives and getting rid of them completely may lead to many difficult changes. These issues back up the USDA for wanting to continue to use market animals. On the other hand PETA believes that the use of market animals is morally wrong and should be completely eradicated. PETA is an animal rights group and feels that we consider doing something [to that would interfere with their needs, we are morally obligated to take them into To PETA the use of market animals for our personal gain is immoral. These animals in question are often subjected to disease and deformities associated with farming, along with confined spaces that can be as extreme as inhibiting the ability to walk around. When it is all said and done animal production raises and kills 9 billion animals a year Rossi and Garner 493). Overall the welfare of market animals is often over looked for efficiency in food production (ASPCA). This moral dilemma favors the side of PETA. Although both sides would have a hard time coming up with a solution that will make both of them happy, a compromise could be made that sits in-between their two beliefs. Currently America has rather loose legislation on animal care with farm animals having very little protection (ASPCA). The animal welfare act, which came into law in 1966, covers warm- blooded animals like dogs and cats but excludes farm animals. An amendment should be made in which farm animals are including under the animal welfare act. Within the amendment proper housing, enrichment, nutrition, and other specific husbandry practices for each species should be clearly stated to ensure no unnecessary suffering continues. Along with this adjustment the Sanson 3 government could subsidize higher welfare farming. This would give farmers and farming corporations an incentive to treat their animals better (Cowen 4). Although far from idea of veganism and a large change in farming practices for the USDA, it is a step towards middle ground for the two organizations. Animal production has long been practiced and it is an important part of American culture. It does not look like it will be completely eradicated, at least not soon. That being said it does not seem to be free from pressure to change. Public opinion on market animal care has become negative with documentaries like Food Inc. showing the down side of animal production. In a recent survey 77% of consumers said they cared about the welfare of farm animals and many even stated they would pay more for humanely raised animals (Animal Welfare Institute). The USDA and PETA may have opposing view but in the future, pressure for better welfare for market animals may lead the USDA to compromise with PETA.
