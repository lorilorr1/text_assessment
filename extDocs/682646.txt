But now, the excessive consumption of natural resources, Causing climate change. Typhoons, landslides, red tide, etc. Many people lose their lodging because of natural disasters, and even die. With the development of science and technology, human beings gradually realize that this is due to their own destruction caused. Today, economic development, more and more serious environmental pollution, especially in developing countries,,, People think that money is more important than the environment, We have only one earth. Humans can only live on earth. However, Some countries are poor because they can only develop the economy first, and they may pollute the environment for money. With more and more serious environmental pollution, More and more countries began to notice environmental pollution. In some developing countries, environmental pollution is very serious. Most of them have begun to focus on solving pollution problems. We ought to sustainable consumption that is beneficial for our life Babayemi, J. O., Ogundiran, M. B., & Osibanjo, O. (2016). Overview of Environmental Hazards and Health Effects of Pollution in Developing Countries: A Case Study of Nigeria. Environmental Quality Management, (1), 51. doi:10.1002/tqem.21480 Environmental destruction of the outstanding performance of several aspects: First, soil water is contaminated. Due to excessive development in recent years, The land is contaminated by factory sewage, the land will not grow plants. These will lead to less food and will eventually affect humans. It will harm human health and bring more social problems. Second, global warming. The greenhouse effect is a serious threat to all mankind. Strange weather will affect agricultural development. Therefore, humans should save energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions Third, the biological Human construction of a large number of houses, a large number of factories, the natural environment becomes less, animals will be less and less.

Journal Of Climate, 23(6), 1544-1562. doi:10.1175/2009JCLI2660.1 Environmental pollution will lead to global warming, bad weather endanger human survival. Michael Howard thinks climate change the real weapon of mass . Author using precipitation data from rain gauge stations over China, in past few years the climate increased the rainy season, resulting in frequent occurrence of flash floods, However, in the northern region has led to drought, food to reduce income, Elevated temperatures will create large typhoons, hurricanes and other disasters. Suffered and faced catastrophe every year more and more, The number of lost lives and money is growing, A large number of rainy season in the south led to frequent floods, many houses were destroyed. Borthakur, A. (2016). Health and environmental hazards of electronic waste in India. Journal Of Environmental Health, (8), 18. With the rapid development of information technology, Now the electronics product is upgrading, e-waste as a problem in world. The author believes that the current, if the unreasonable treatment of these e-waste, disposal will cause great environmental pollution. The United States is the largest consumer of electronic products, but also the largest producer of electronic waste. Beginning in 2002, the United States introduced a waste recycling regulations. The bill provides that customers have to pay e-waste recycling fees. High trade deficit led to many businessmen to take risks, Transport electronic waste ship to developing or underdeveloped areas to dump or sell. The authors mentioned that in India they received a large number of electronic waste from developed countries, They use simple tools to handle these rubbish, or even use hammers and scissors to separate The remaining parts into the fire. Because while burning, the metal will not melt, but worthless plastic shell will be burned. Wait until the burning is end, they will use water to clean, get the metal they want. However, contaminated water can free into the ground inside cause land contamination. Because the national economy is underdeveloped, They just want to get a little bit of metal for sale to get money. The influx of a large number of electronic waste, causing environmental destruction. Local people have poor health their children are playing in the rubbish mountain. Now leading to more and more children get the disease. Already poor families because the disease becomes poorer. But they have no other source of income, only more hard to deal with electronic waste. It lead to a vicious circle. Sancho, F. (2010). Double dividend effectiveness of energy tax policies and the elasticity of substitution: A CGE appraisal. Energy Policy, 38(6), 2927-2933. The authors discuss the tax levied by the government, that the environmental protection tax can promote fiscal revenue, but not the best way. With the development of thinking. More and more countries began to set the law to build a beautiful environment. The government imposes high taxes on high-polluting enterprises to limit pollution. Loans to enterprises to buy energy-saving equipment. Environmental protection is conducive to human development. This is why sustainable consumption is good for our live. If we do not pay attention to environmental protection, the victim is their own. Works Cited Babayemi, J. O., Ogundiran, M. B., & Osibanjo, O. (2016).
