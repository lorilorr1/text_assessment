1 Sandra Estrada Adam Phillips ENC 1102 01/29/2017 Women in society Throughout history, society has always been characterized by being sexist. Giving priority to men, generally considering women inferior to men and even considering women as objects that did not have any value. Through the history of human beings, the position of women in the world has been changing, while the society is evolving and accepting the equality between men and women. Many years ago, women were considered and object, women were expected to be at home, taking care of the family, the house and the kids. However, with the industrial revolution and the two world wars, women started to have more importance in the society and started to be an actual part of the society. Although women started to be part of the society, they were never considered completely equal to men. For this reason, many organizations and foundations are starting to support and protect vulnerable genre groups, that are ready to work together for a better society. Nowadays many different ideas and revolutionary organizations are trying to change the concept and idea of women in society. Feminist women are working together to be considered equal than men. Be respected as a person and not only categorized by gender, have the same opportunities as men and not be rejected for being women. Organization for Women is an international and feminist organization that is ready to help women, fighting for the respect of human rights and trying to make society as equal as possible. As it is mentioned in its website focuses on a broad range of rights issues, including economic justice, pay 2 equity, racial discrimination, health and body image, women with disabilities, reproductive rights and justice, family law, marriage and family formation rights of same-sex couples, representation of women in the media, and global feminist (NOW foundation). This foundation focuses in women, giving them an opportunity to be a valid part of the society, helping to defend their rights and their position in the society. If women fight together they are going to succeed together. In the other hand, some organizations agree that men and women are already equal and that are being treated equally. coalition for is a perfect example of this kind of organizations, this is not a sexist organization nor a gender associated organization. On this organization, men and women are working together against stereotypes and inequality, trying to make society as equal as possible. As the NCFM web page mentioned, they are not only working for segregated or vulnerable groups of people they are working together for everyone, against stereotypes and inequality. This foundation considers that society is already equal, and the real problem is that nobody accepts equality as part of their daily life, because they are already used to a sexist society full of stereotyped ideas and behaviors. Even though many people consider that society is already equal, that women are not a minority, that women are not inferior nor weaker than men. Surveys and investigations show the opposite National Family Violence Survey showed that 1 in 4 women in the United States will be physically or sexually assaulted by a partner at some point in her lifetime. Nearly 5 million violent victimizations are experienced by females over the age of 12 every (Sianko, p. 169). Such surveys and documents show that society remains sexist, that there is no equality between men and women and that women are weaker than men for most of the societies. This kind of studies are the perfect proof that we need organizations and foundations like 3 Organization for Women that are ready to help women as a group of minorities and a vulnerable part of the society. Although many feminist groups are ready to help any vulnerable group and are trying to fight for human rights specially defending rights. Some other groups are trying to prove that men and women are already equal, that society only is judging by stereotypes and inequalities made up by the society rather than real differences between men and women. interpret human rights relative to their in-group, and so the interpretation is affected by the status position within the societal (Abrams, p. 29) Men and women are already equal, so organizations and foundations need to work together to eliminate every stereotype and unequal idea that exist in every person as an individual rather than working for genre inequality. Every organization and foundation that works for the society should be working to help everyone rather than helping a specific group of people. Even though organizations such as and are very specific and concentrated in the group of people that they are working for, they are helping to make a better society in they own way. Those organizations are helping specific groups of people because they considered that those groups are the most vulnerable of the society. However, at it is mentioned in the article Trusts Local Human Rights every organization that helps the society should work together with the human rights and being guided by those. Which should be respected by all humans. In conclusion, everyone should work for a better society, human beings have gone through many events that have made society evolve and changed the its reality. Probably many people consider that society is not equal, that men and women are being treated different and that many stereotypes are guiding the actual society. That women are considered inferior as men and 4 that do not have the same importance in the society. However, every organization is helping people to succeed in life and are working together for a better society. Many organizations are empowering men and women, to work together and be better in life and work environments. 5 Works Cited Abrams, Dominic, et al.
