Salas 1 Jessica Salas Kristin Gocinski ENC1102 21 April 2017 Have a Toast for Change! One could actually buy a gun, vote for the future leader of our country, adopt a child, or serve in the army at the age of 18 but is not trusted enough to handle alcohol. The minimum legal drinking age should be changed from 21 to 18 because it is time to stop sweeping the known fact that many underage kids, especially college students, consume alcohol illegally under the rug. According to the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, website, 4 out of 5 college students drink alcohol and of that, half of the ones who drink do so by binge drinking (NCADD). St. catholic center also had their fair share on discussing the topic at hand but have not yet become involved. Lowering the drinking age would be beneficial to not only teenagers but to St. catholic center since they are a campus church and want the best for the students so supporting this movement would ensure safer behaviors amongst their participants. First of all, the negative behaviors and effects associated with underage drinking are enough grounds to steer towards the possibility of lowering the drinking age to 18, as opposed to 21. Lowering the drinking age would not only prevent behaviors such as binge drinking but it will also prevent its harms and effects from taking its toll on those who choose to underage drink. According to Merriam Webster, binge means unrestrained and often excessive (Merriam-Webster). Most people may wonder as to why teens partake in actions like these, but it could root from the law of 21. Since these teens are not allowed to consume alcohol, once they obtain it they tend to abuse it which is common amongst college students. It Salas 2 is seen as some taboo item which adds an almost adrenaline rush when they finally get their hands on it. Also, some teens may not even feel the desire to drink but the pressure to. Since it allowed to do, they may want to look cool and rebellious yet they endanger themselves. Sandra article named the Dialogue: Reducing Minimum Legal Drinking Age Laws from 21 to states how appears that alcohol produces greater impairments in learning and more pervasive brain damage in adolescents than in (Jones par 18). This goes to show that allowing teens to continue this behavior will come at a price. All of these reasons considered, lowering the minimum drinking age will bring about many benefits and diminish the dangers of abusing alcohol thus reducing the chances of affecting the health of teenagers and college students around the country. Although not being directly involved with this movement, there is room for a church in this debate. Especially a church that resides directly on a college campus, this being St. Catholic center. St. catholic center is located on Texas Agricultural and Mechanical University so their main audience consists of the college students who attend the school. What they strive to do or what their mission statement is, as found on their website, to form Apostles for the Church and (St. Catholic Center). Since they are located within a campus, their main target is college students and leading them to follow the rules of their religion. St. is a catholic center so there are certain behaviors and beliefs that are practiced within the religion which they hope that the college students follow. The main stereotype would be that a church would have absolutely nothing to do with people who consume alcohol at all but St. actually has made their own comments about the matter which foreshadow a possibility of a common ground. Both lowering the legal drinking age and St. church have enough room to coincide and even bring about some benefits. As found on their website, St. Mary states they Salas 3 the spiritual development of over 13,000 college (St. Catholic Center). This shows that they have the best interest of the students in mind which would mean they would advocate for their students consuming alcohol safely. Since the entire concept behind making the legal drinking age 18 is to ensure safety for people at that age shows that these two could actually collaborate. St. would benefit from this because they would not only have safety amongst their congregation but less people sinning. Also found on their website, they mention how the law is a sin, if it is a just law, therefore underage drinking without your parents around is a (St. Catholic Center). If the law allowed people in their college to legally consume alcohol then they would not be performing a sin which is what every church wants their followers to stray away from. There is a mutual benefit for people who want to lower the drinking age in that they need supporters. Amethyst Initiative is an organization and petition formed that is signed by several schools who also hope to stop the epidemic of college binge drinking. According to the article Presidents Ask Public to Rethink Drinking by John Dart, it states how comprehensive study on heavy drinking (at least five drinks in a row) among college students showed that the trend peaked in 1984 but remained (Dart 16). With this being said, since the church lies on Texas Agricultural and Mechanical University campus grounds, it could be another school added to their list thus advancing their following. There are several things that St. could do to be able to acquire these benefits and come together as one with the movement of lowering the drinking age. First and foremost, they must talk to their chancellor into signing the Amethyst Initiative. This is definitely a step towards getting this law changed but is a long process and requires the most support it could get. Second, the church must start informing their student participants that their actions are not Salas 4 technically frowned upon and they must start doing things safely. Doing this will shed light on the dangers of binge drinking and why they should stop. For example, the Christian article states how epidemic of binge drinking has serious consequences: students who engage in it are far more likely to miss classes, injure themselves and others, and engage in risky sexual (2008). All of which the church, or anyone, would not want the teens to partake in. The main priority is the safety of these 18 and plus year olds so doing anything to help stop them from hurting themselves is ideal. All in all, there are many factors to be considered when determining whether to change the legal drinking age or not. Lowering the drinking age to 18 would be ideal because it prevents minors from drinking in hiding thus irresponsibly. St. catholic center could attest to that because they also want the best for the teens who attend their masses and events so it would clearly be beneficial to them as well and they could achieve it if they got involved, signed petitions, and spread the word. All these efforts could help reduce the dangerous act of binge drinking and show 18 year olds that they are responsible to handle this as well.
