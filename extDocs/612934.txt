This act is in place just as another way to ensure better quality and safety for the betterment of the public. Throughout the website there are many images and statements used to reassure the fact that their main goal is to provide safety for the public. In analyzing the visuals in the first image what really stands out is the connection between the mother and child. The expression on the mothers face gives off a warm and positive feeling to the audience that feels comforting. This image not only makes the audience smile, but it includes other visual appeals to the eye such as the bright colors along with different textures (Sheffield). These elements of the image are what make it unique from the others on the website. most sweeping reform of our food safety laws in more than 70 years aims to ensure the U.S. food supply is safe by focusing on prevention (U S Food and Drug Administration Home The caption that describes the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act provides the audience with an example of how they ensure safety by focusing on prevention. When analyzing the use of rhetoric in this image there are many aspects that are demonstrative of the different appeals.

This shows the audience that if a mother trusts the food enough to give it to her child then the food must be safe to consume. The common phrase knows is conceptualized in this image which appeals to the viewers logic. The Student 3 appeal to emotion is shown in the way that the mother is looking at her child. The expression on her face along with having a baby in the photo shows the use of pathos. The connection shared between the two of them demonstrates kairos, by having the moment perfectly timed. Ethos is present in the caption, as it provides credibility through the use of an example of one of their laws.

In the second photo the FDA uses a multitude of images to show the different contexts of public health that they deal with. As opposed to the other photo this one is not as positive and sends a different message to the audience. By placing all of these different images together the administration is showing that they are responsible for many different aspects of human health. They are able to have many of the different areas of health represented in one image. Having a cool toned color pallet makes this collage blend well and causes the viewers eyes to flow from one image to another (Sheffield). In analyzing the visual aspects of this image, what immediately sticks out is photo in the right hand corner. This photo in particular speaks volume about the FDA, by showing that they do not support the use of cigarettes. The caption reiterates the amount of responsibility that the FDA has when it comes to public health. Being ensures that the product or food is of high quality by meeting the administrations standards. The text that says many ways the FDA is responsible for protecting the public also may cause the reader to question whether or not the items in the images are approved (U S Food and Drug Administration Home Page). This image also has many appeals within each individual photo. The appeal to logic in this image is evident because of the seriousness of these photos and the responsibility that the FDA is showing that they hold. Ethos is used in this image through the FDA mentioning how they hold Student 4 responsibilities, which shows credibility. By capturing images of drugs, cigarettes, and the CAT scan machine the image appeals to the audiences emotions because these objects deal with serious issues. Kairos is used in this image by the breaking of the cigarette, which shows a perfect example of the right thing at the right time. In this case that is getting rid of something harmful in order to better the health of the public. These appeals help show the audience that the FDA wants to provide safety for the public. The Federal Drug Administration is in charge of guaranteeing that products distributed by manufacturers are safe, nutritional, and of high quality. The rhetorical strategies used on the website establish the administrations credibility and responsibility. By forming different acts and laws the FDA delivers safety standards in the publics best interest and certify that the nutritional values placed on products are valid (Statement of Policy - Foods Derived from New Plant Varieties). The two images, though different in appearance, deliver similar messages to the audience that the FDA is in control and cares about product quality and safety.
