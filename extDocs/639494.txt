MACMILLAN Kelcie MacMillan ENC 1102 H. Campbell 1/29/2016 Vaccination Debate: Vaccine Free and the Center for Disease Control For many years, vaccinations have been the forerunner of numerous arguments in the medical world. Vaccines were first administered successfully in 1796, when Edward Jenner created a vaccination against smallpox. This particular vaccination was used for at least 200 years thereafter, with slight modifications over time in order to achieve the best results. Hospital of Philadelphia) In recent years, the divide between Americans supporting or opposing vaccinations has grown larger. Due to adverse reactions to vaccinations, many citizens have become unsure as to if vaccinations are truly helpful, or inherently harmful. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends 9 different kinds of vaccinations to be administered to children ages 0-6. Although the CDC recognizes that there are some adverse reactions to vaccinations, they still see them as a necessity. Vaccine Free (VF) is an organization with the intent to share the knowledge of how harmful vaccines can be. Their primary goal is to educate the public about natural immunity and that vaccines are not essential. These two groups, while in disagreement about the necessity of vaccines, are bonded by their desire to help children and spread awareness and education to the public. These two groups could join together by creating and co-funding a joint organization with the goal to create non-toxin containing vaccine alternatives that could be safely administered to children. MACMILLAN Vaccine Free (VF) is a Massachusetts-based non-profit organization that was founded in order to educate the public on the harmful nature of vaccinations. Some of their objectives are stated as follows: create a vaccine-free world where infants and children are nurtured by breast- milk, clean water, plentiful nutritious food, and lots of love. To dispel the myth that vaccines are safe and To educate policymakers, health-care professionals, the legal profession, governors, Massachusetts legislators, the United Nations leadership, the US Congress, the President, and parents the world over, that all vaccines have never been safe or effective in preventing childhood (Vaccine Free) Those in opposition to federally mandated vaccinations take this viewpoint for a number of reasons; they argue that vaccinations are painful, they contain harmful ingredients, they can cause disorders and death, and the government has no right to tell others what to administer to their children. In the past, organizations like the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) were established to ensure an adequate supply of vaccines, stabilize vaccine costs, and establish and maintain an accessible and efficient forum for individuals found to be injured by certain  (US Department of Health and Human Services) Since its creation in 1986, this organization has paid around $3 billion dollars in order to cover costs of medical compensation and lawsuits. Numerous organizations, such as VF, work every day to inform others and protect children across the country. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) is a government-run organization that as the national focus for developing and applying disease prevention and control, environmental health, and health promotion and health education activities designed to improve the health of the people of the United (Center for Disease Control). The CDC recommends 29 doses of 9 vaccines for children by age 6, a seemingly high number, but it is estimated that American children were saved from death and 322 million cases of childhood illnesses were MACMILLAN prevented between 1994 and 2014 due to (Gholipour) The CDC argues that while some vaccinations do contain harmful ingredients such as formaldehyde, aluminum, and thimerosal, the amounts in which they are used are not harmful, especially in comparison to what children are exposed to every day. (King-Heyworth) Before any vaccine is marketed or distributed, they are first tested for ten years or more in order to insure the smallest risk possible when administered. These two organizations seemingly at odds with one another still have many things in common. Both VF and the CDC strive to share accurate information and educate the public. Both organizations wish to administer the best care possible to children and adults, and do extensive research in order to prevent misinformation or adverse reactions to vaccinations. To create a feasible compromise, an option for these organizations would be to combine forces, creating a new organization with the goal of finding vaccination alternatives. These vaccination alternatives could be focused on being all-natural and/or non-toxic substances that could be injected or after time, administered orally. This organization could be a sub-sector of the CDC and co-funded by the government as well as VF, or it could be a completely separate body entirely, independent from the government but still co-funded by the CDC and VF. In conclusion, Vaccine Free and the Center for Disease Control are two organizations with different goals that are bonded by core values focusing on education and public health. If they were to successfully join together and create a compromise, the world of vaccinations could be entirely changed. Creating a separate organization focused on researching and formulating non- toxic vaccinations could lead to easier reproduction, less adverse reaction and risk, and farther distribution to other countries that are less fortunate and do not have access to vaccines.
