Student 1 Student Dr. Thornton ENC 1102 26 March 2017 Solar Energy and Hydropower Helping the Environment In recent years, the rapid growth of damage caused by greenhouse gases has caused for different organizations to support different ways on using renewable energy sources that help reduce the climate impact. Finding the best environmentally friendly alternative source of power has been a major discussion. The Solar Energy Industries Association is a stakeholder that supports the use of solar power as main energy, on the other hand The National Hydropower Association is a stakeholder that supports the use of hydropower. The two stakeholders have had conflict in the past on which kind of energy would benefit the environment more. While an alternative way of obtaining energy will benefit the environment and help reduce damage to the ozone layer, the two stakeholder could work together to compromise on an alternative solution; Hydropower could be used by large corporations and large cities while solar power could be used for small businesses and homes. According to the Solar Energy Industries website, their main goal is to spread access the most abundant form of renewable energy. energy is the cleanest and most abundant renewable energy source available, and the U.S. has some of the richest solar resources in the world. Modern technology can harness this energy for a variety of uses, including generating electricity, providing light or a comfortable interior environment, and heating water for domestic, commercial, or industrial (SEIA). Solar energy can be accessed by the public, anyone can make Student 2 use of the sun. The usage of solar panels is convenient and can be a choice anyone can make since it is easy to access and obtain. Solar Energy : Application, Economics, and Public Perception by Adaramola States that more countries are considering using solar energy as main source of power do to the rise in energy demand. Solar power can be accessed by many countries and everyone can use the sun as energy. U.S. solar market faces both challenges and opportunities; the industry is working to scale up the production of solar technology, and drive down manufacturing and installation (SEIA). Even through the instillation cost for solar panels can be quite expensive, organizations such as SEIA are working on making the cost more affordable. In the long run is worth expanding to use solar energy because you must only install the panels once then you can acquire solar power. The National Hydropower main goal is to spread access to the most climate friendly form of renewable energy. about three percent of all U.S reservoirs are equipped with hydropower. Hydro help nation avoid 200 million metric tons of (Hydro) The usage of Hydropower can avoid Co2 production and is an environmentally friendly of obtaining energy. According to Climate Informed Long Term Seasonal Forecasts of Hydroenergy Inflow for the Brazilian Hydropower System By lima present, the planning of reservoir operation and energy production in Brazil is made with no reliable long term (one season or longer lead times) streamflow forecasts. Here we use the NINO3 index and the main modes of the tropical Pacific thermocline structure as climate predictors in order to achieve skillful forecasts at long Using Hydropower has benefited Brazil in many ways. Using hydropower has a great impact on climate change, and helps reduce creation of greenhouse gases. NHA seeks to secure a reliable energy source that is good economically and environmentally friendly, advocating for the usage of hydropower throughout the united states. Student 3 Both main concern is to encourage people to use an alternative source of power, using renewable energy that would benefit the environment. NHA and SEIA could benefit by working together to spread awareness of the benefits of using renewable energy. If each stakeholder would focus on a specific audience, they could create a larger impact on their goal. They could come to a compromise, NHA could only focus on large corporations and large cities that would benefit from using hydropower while SEIA could only focus on individual homes or small businesses that could benefit from using solar energy. According to A multi- Reservoir Based Water-Hydroenergy Managemnt Model for Identifying the Risk Horizon of Regional Resources- Energy Policy Under Uncertainties By Zeng hybrid MWH model can plan human-recourse-energy with a robust and effective manner. Results can support adjusting water-energy policy to satisfy increasing Hydropower can produce high quantities of energy and meet the high demands of a large city. NHA would benefit from the compromise since they would be helping large cities as well as large corporations produce renewable energy in an efficient and affordable way. A Hydroenergy generating plant structure is arranged in a body of water, the structure compromising a top portion, a bottom portion and walls between the top and bottom portions define a reservoir therein, having an inner volume for water according to Generating hydroenergy by Aaltonen. The form hydropower plant is very convenient for large corporation that may be near water, they can be near a hydroenergy plan that will produce the power. SEIA would benefit from the compromise because they would be helping individuals who can have solar panels in their homes as well as small businesses who can afford to use solar energy and would save energy this way. Solar Energy: the state of the art: ISES position paper by Gordon states that the most common way of harnessing energy from the sun is through Student 4 photovoltaic panels, like the ones on roof tops. These large panels are perfect for homes and business such as farms, that can have the large panels on their roofs. According to Solar Energy: An Introduction by Mackay these photovoltaic devices present active and passive solar thermal energy conversion. People would be able to benefit from using the sun, since it is the most abundant form of energy. The National Hydropower Association and the Solar Energy Association are both stakeholder who are interested in promoting the use of renewable energy. Their main concern is finding a source of energy that is environmentally friendly. They would both benefit from a compromise where NHA would focus on being used by large cities and corporations while SEIA could be used by homes and small business. The Compromise would help the stakeholders reach their goal and would also help people benefit from using an alternative source of power. (WC: 1218) Works Cited Student 5 Energy Industries SEIA.org.
