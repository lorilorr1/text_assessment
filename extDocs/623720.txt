Immigration becomes an issue when one in power brings light upon the issue otherwise the United States benefits from it greatly. The United States takes the immigrants, gives them work and a place to live so they can live where they work. These immigrants do work that some of us, Americans find boring, tedious and physically demanding, yet they do not mind the work because they hope to one day live the American dream. On the other hand, people do not think that immigrants deserve to be housed and given jobs because they take jobs away from the unemployed that are already citizens of the United States of America. The two sides that constantly debate over this topic are the illegal immigrants and the federal government. This leads to the issue of whether or not further regulation on immigration into the United States is of paramount priority for the citizens of this country. If so, it must be done in a demeanor that reflects the values and morals of this countries foundation. Illegal immigrant workers comprise the majority of agricultural jobs in this country, and state and local governments benefit greatly from it but the federal government resents it. The field of agriculture is predominantly Hispanic-American immigrant workers, who, unfortunately make a living off minimum wage. This goes to show that when our government cracks down on immigration, certain employers, businesses and towns will suffer. Illegal immigrants dominate the field of agriculture so much so that a study was done by Steven McKeighan 2 Zahniser about the impacts of two different scenarios regarding immigration policies. The first scenario was named the H2-A program and it basically tries to group together legal immigrant workers in order to perform the jobs of illegal immigrants in hopes of leaving the illegal people without pay (Zahniser, AJAE Volume 94 Issue 2, 2017). The problem with this program is that there is no possible way to have as many legal immigrant laborers as there are illegal workers. From the perspective of these illegal workers, as long as they are not wreaking havoc on society or breaking the law in a way that endangers the public, why should they be exiled when they are providing needed services for our country. The other stakeholder that holds a prominent side in this debate is the federal government. For such a long time the federal government has blamed state and local governments for the increasing illegal immigrant population (Jorgensen 1997). It is a known fact that state and local governments profit off the illegal labor chores and it is because of this that there has been reluctance to change the policies. After much political debate the federal government conceded and granted the states with immense immigration rates with grants in order to support the growing populations (Jorgensen 1997). This was a reasonable compromise for the time being, until the population got out of hand. The United States is still noticing growing rates of illegal immigration and it is because of this that the federal government is striving to reach mutuality. Common ground can and will only be reached as long as these two stakeholders can work together and understand the other side of the issue within the situation. The perspective is that they are providing much needed service for the agriculture industry and that as long as they are productive they should not be exiled. The federal perspective would be that there are too many illegal immigrants in this nation and it is time to start giving jobs back to hard working Americans that are in this country legally. A form of common ground McKeighan 3 would consist of a place in the economy for many if not all the illegal immigrants who currently produce revenue. Thus, sending all the illegal immigrants who are not productive or have criminal records out of the United States in a mass scale deportation. This could open job opportunities and living space for citizens of this country or people legally residing in the United States. Perhaps the answer would be to propose an international cooperation project that could relocate a number of illegal immigrant workers from the United States to another country like Canada in order to lessen the burden on the US population growth and to help with agricultural needs of other countries. The immigration status of this country has been extremely lenient for quite some time which has allowed for state and local governments to build entire communities around economies sustained by illegal immigrants. Though this may be profitable and beneficial for many Americans it is taking away jobs from hard working American citizens. Just because illegal immigrants are willing to work in this country for low wage does not mean that is the right thing to do. If the federal government would have stepped in to relocate these refugees instead of grant them access, this country would not have the immigrant population growth that it is seeing today. With the recent election, there has been much light shed on the issue of immigration and it is just now that the federal government is working toward a solution. If at all possible, the best solution would be one that sustains the needed labor for American workers in the field of agriculture and relocate the productive illegal members of these societies to a place where they can continue work for the steady growth of the economy.
