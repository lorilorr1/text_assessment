Mateo Knight U96540446 ENC1102 Nuclear Waste in Space The disaster at Chernobyl in 1986 was one of the largest nuclear power plant disasters to date. Acute radiation syndrome was confirmed in 134 people on-site and involved with the clean-up Nuclear waste is extremely dangerous for humans, as well as the environment, which is why proper disposal of such waste is so important. Ever since there has been nuclear energy in the twentieth century, proper disposal of such waste has concerned ecologists as well as environmentalists. Possibly, by joining forces and funds, ecologists and nuclear power plant companies will be able to safely dispose of radioactive nuclear waste. If the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) are able to collaborate on a project which would dispose of nuclear waste in a safe manner by sending loads of radioactive waste into outer space. The United States Environmental Protection Agency is a government organization that works to reduce environmental risk. The mission statement is to protect human health and the environment While keeping their mission statement in mind in regards to energy consumption, there is a specific regulation regarding has laws and regulations in order to keep safety a priority. For example, there is a specific regulation which sets and environmental standard for the disposal of The proper disposal of this material plays such a key role in preservation of the Earth because it may take up to 100,000 years in some cases for such material to decay. Environmentalists have come up with multiple ideas and concepts regarding safe disposal. For example, the NRC has a method of disposing of high level waste (HLW) that still really good for the environment. With this method, the NRC plans on permanently storing these high levels of radioactive waste in a mountain in Yucca, Nevada The issue with radioactive dumping in mountains is that there is a possibility of contamination of soil and even water. Even with regulations put in place by the EPA, there are even better ways to protect humans and the Earth, which would follow their mission statement. By completely dispelling radioactive waste into outer space, the EPA will be further working towards their mission statement of human health and the environment Like the EPA, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is an organization in which human as well as environmental health is in focus. The NRC was created by Congress in 1974 and works with the mission to ensure the safe use of radioactive materials for beneficial civilian purposes while protecting people and the environment As a result of nuclear power plant disasters, such as Chernobyl, nuclear energy is seen as a threat to many environmentalists. However, research presents data that suggests that there is a negative correlation between nuclear energy consumption and CO2 emission (Baek). This creates the possibility to expand on nuclear energy consumption, while directly reducing emission of carbon dioxide, which is one of the greenhouse gases that environmentalists claim is directly damaging the atmosphere, speeding up global warming. Alternative methods of energy consumption tend to produce large quantities of CO2. In fact, the burning of fossil fuels is the primary source of CO2 emission in the world So, by reducing the amount of non- renewable resources used across the globe, and replacing those methods with nuclear energy, there should also be a steady decline in greenhouse gases emitted. In turn, this can lead to saving the atmosphere and slow down the process of global warming. In order to achieve a successful transition from non-renewable resources to nuclear energy, there must be a much more effective plan for disposing of large amounts of radioactive byproduct. Introducing a concept of this magnitude would require large organizations and relatively a good amount of funds. This is the exact reason why the EPA and NCR are able to collaborate on a project of this size because, they have the resources and influence to bring something like dispelling nuclear waste into outer space even possible. A concept presented by Kim introduces the plan of flying nuclear waste into outer space (Kim). In the concept, even a failsafe is in place, so even with a systematic malfunction, the waste will be flying so low to the surface that it is only possible that it falls in the water.
