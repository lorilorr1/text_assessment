Akhsambiyev 1 Askar Akhsambiyev Ms. Ashely Tisdale Composition I 5 Feb. 2017 Pharmaceuticals Impact On People In 21st Century For the past decade more than 150,000 people in United States died from the overdose of prescription drugs. Nowadays people are addicted to pharmaceutical pills. Not all of the medical drugs are bad, everyday all over the world people release their pain, heal affected areas of the bodies and fight with different types of diseases by consuming these drugs. The first pharmaceuticals were invested in the middle of 19th Century. Wholesale manufacture of botanical based drugs like quinine and morphine also started in about these years. After this pharmaceuticals started to use in most of the countries in the world and development and research about the new medical drugs continued from that moment. Average people, doctors, scientists, government, professors and businessmen; -everyone were interested and partially involved in this industry. Life became different for the 21st Century people- public can not imagine their lives without pharmaceuticals. There is a huge number of different type of drugs existing for a different type of purposes today. Some of them are relatively cheap and could be found in any local dug store, usually plant based and weak. The other medical drugs are strong and could be sold only with the professional prescription, it is against the law to sell strong drugs without the prescription to a random person. Are strong pharmaceuticals helpful or dangerous, are the drugs made to kill one disease or introduce a new one, are these drugs made for the health of society or for money? All of Akhsambiyev 2 three questions above are similar, because all three are related to this topic and the overall question basically is do pharmacies worth it, or is it just the business? Lee, Joo-Young1, and Paul2 Hunt. Human Rights Responsibilities Of Pharmaceutical Companies In Relation To Access To  Journal Of Law, Medicine & Ethics 40.2 (2012): 220-233. Education Source. Web. 5 Feb. 2017. This article argues about wether or not to reinforce allowing access to more medicine or as it is a shared liability. This article discusses human rights and if there is a need of enhancing the access, some people have a belief that the society have all the rights to access more medicine and for the most of the situations in the article it talks about a stronger type of drugs. The article mentions different opinion of different people, few people from the government agree with this because as they say it will increase the economic level of the country. On the other side then, some of the public society disagree with this as they say that most of the buyers will use the stronger drugs not for the recreational use, but for some illegal use or to resell, basically just for the pleasure. The other people from the government and politics are on these side as the main thought is that economy will not increase, and there is a place to be for more drug addict homeless people and shoplifting after opening more access.

Ethical Challenges In The Pharmaceutical  Pharmaceuticals Policy & Law 14.2-4 (2012): 123-127. Business Source Alumni Edition. Web. 5 Feb. 2017. This article discusses the pharmaceutical industry, advantages and disadvantages. It talks about how hard is it to run an industry like this, how risk it is. This type of industry need to co- Akhsambiyev 3 operate with the suppliers as it will need a batch of chemicals on most of the products produced there. The risk of running it is that if the business will be robbed, it could be robbed for the rare type of chemicals used there to produce medical drugs. The big advantage then that this type of industry is actually helping people compared to others, not too many competitors per city or village, again for the reason of a big risk. According to the article 80% of the population do not have or has very little access to medicine. (p.123) Developing a new drug is complicated too, industry has to run all the ethical concepts, provide involved in experiments people with safety and security. This article as well as a previous one is from a legitimate source, a tested website. This sources fits to the USF academia and are full texted and peer reviewed. One more thing is that this article fits into the years that it needs to be, correct years of the project. Tironi, Paula.

Academic OneFile. Web. 13 Feb. 2017. This article talks about the additional fees for the brand drug manufactures. It has come to an extent when people have everything they could ever imagine of in the stores to buy. There is a huge amount of different pharmacy related brands. There are re-sellers, brands who make research, experiments and try to find a solution for all of the diseases. For different reasons some products for this brand could be very pricy and at the same time the only drug for a particular disease. In 2011 there was a fee introduced to all of the businesses who engaged with the manufacture or import of pre scripted drugs. To put it mildly these fees were high and increase every year. Cause for introducing the fee was to provide with the pharmacy drugs different type of federal health care programs like: Veterans Affair, TRICARE, Medicare etc. Government thinks about people who are in these programs listed above and that is very good of them. There is one problem that occurred, it was either these businesses prices for drugs went higher for the average ! Akhsambiyev 5 people, or the business itself went bankrupt in some period of time.
