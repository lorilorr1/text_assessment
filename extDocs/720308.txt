Shwe 1 Myitzu Shwe Anastasia J. Khawaja, MS ENC 1101: Composition I (Section 903) 2017 April 19 Islamophobia and its Social and Political Consequences In Our Society The ongoing terror and refugee crisis around the world has contributed to an alarming growing numbers of stigma and hate crimes against innocent Muslims this negative and discriminatory conceptualization around Muslim population can be termed as The recent rise in Islamophobia calls for a research that considers perspective for Muslim American population. Although many policy makers and governments around the world have addressed that counter-terrorism measures were not aimed solely at Islamic communities and have reassured the public that law enforcement agencies have applied laws equally without discrimination, human rights of Arabs and Muslims have been increasingly threatened by anti-Muslim rhetoric, airport screenings, traffic stops, detentions, deportations and hate crimes across United States and Europe, and therefore research and education to detest stereotypes and myths of Islamic culture as well as to combat Islamophobia should be considered. As of 2017, many Muslim Americans believe that Islamophobia is worse now that it has ever been even worse than it was after in 2001. 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, Syrian refugee crisis and politicians in 2016 United States Election using unfortunate events to lead nationalist movements have triggered an unprecedented spike in Islamophobia in the United States (Jenkins, 2016). Samari (2016) even conveys that consequence of being labeled, stigmatized and being discriminated by their choice of culture and religion have negatively impacted in terms of health peradigm on innocent Muslim Americans who have nothing to do with terrorist attacks going on around around the world. In addition, Shwe 2 McQueeney (2014) states that negative persumptions are not only against actual Muslim population but many people in the western world believe myths of women wearing a hijab or veil and airline passsengers with Arab-sounding last names could be suicide bombers. Hate crimes have been targeted toward South Asian populations who majority do not have Islamic faith but look like a terrorist with turban on their Both political rhetoric and national security policing justify scruitny of Muslim Americans has a long history in the United States such as denying citizenship for certain Americans with Islamic faiith and targeted policing. Although Federal Beureau of Investigation (FBI) shows that only 5% of domestic terrorist attacks involve a Muslim culprit, Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) is built upon stereotypes of Muslims and practice targeted policing on Muslim Americans and their communities (Beydoun, 2015) Even though a belief by many that fighting against Islamophobia and protecting the human rights over servaillance for counter terrorism of many Muslims caudle Radical Islamic terrorist attacks. Frisch (2008) conveys that Radical Islamism poses a political challenge in the modern world which is like that of no other religion movement and it is threatening the liberal democratic ideology. However, research has shown that targeting and isolating Islamic communities in counter terrorism efforts lead to an environment of disaffection and disempowerment and does nothing but isolate the very community that best understands the radical islamic challenges. United Nations Secretary General Guterres said in 2017 February that will never be successful in fighting terrorism in Syria if an inclusive political solution is not found for the Syrian Islamophobia is not caudling Radical Islams but in fact, fueling terrorism around the world. In conclusion, reversing the slow build up and historically imbedded Islamophobia will not be going away anytime soon however, education on the myths of Muslim culture and religion from academic communities to governments and public will help decrease volitile Shwe 3 actions against many innocent Muslims and increase its well beings physically and psychologically. Despite the affort of influential anti-Islamic forces such as Fox News in the United States are stroking to ignite paranoia among the public as they portray opening doors to Muslim communites could lead to domestic terror attacks and caudling terrorists, Zunes (2017) conveys that vulnerable and alienated individuals in disproportionately part of underclass, often in segregated neighborhoods, facing discrimination employment, harrassment by police are susceptible to and target for recruitment by terrorist groups. Zunes (2017) has shown that when vulnerable minority groups such as Muslims of immigrant families in North America and Europe have been given fair chances to integrate and have been protected from feeling further alienated by governments and the public, the community tend to become productive citizens, start small businesses and put a lot more money into the social system. Shielding Islamic communities from Islamophobia encourages the community to be a part of a nation that they belong and stop some from becoming susceptible to violent extremism.
