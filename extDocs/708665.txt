Elsingergy 1 Abdulrahman Elsingergy Dr. Theodore J Murray ENC1102.906 16 April 2017 Syrian Conflict and Children What happens when you switch on the news nowadays? Do you always listen to some good reports about optimism and other topics? Well, in reality, this is not how the world around us looks like. On other sides of the world, people are suffering and crying without us knowing about them. Others suffer while we know about them, but unfortunately, we are helpless. Among those are the Syrian children. Since the conflict started in March 2011, their lives have been drastically distressed, ripped, tormented and maybe scarred. While each side of the conflict is concerned about achieving its goals, another side is being affected behind the curtains, and not much attention is given from the world. Hence, people should try to be aware of how the Syrian children suffer and help them through the available means. One does not have to be from a specific religious background or of certain political inclinations to be eligible for helping them; rather, the only eligibility is being human. Back in September 2015, the picture of Syrian child, Alan lifeless body, washed on a Turkish beach, went viral on the internet, and broke our hearts. For a moment, people began to be aware about what is happening to Syrian 1Choices for syrian children (Choices) Elsingergy 2 children, and care about them (Costello). However, almost two years have passed since that photo, and unfortunately, the majority forgot about it. A good question one might ask is, how do the Syrian children actually suffer, and what happens to them? In order to be able to sympathize better with Syrian children, one might want to know the problems that they face. According to an article published by the British newspaper, The Telegraph, Syrian children are suffering after witnessing six years of war and violence (Sanchez). The article mentions that a study conducted by a charitable organization called Save the Children, proved that the children are in the most state of (Sanchez). The parents said that their children showed signs of aggressive, distressed and violent behaviors including, speech disorders, bedwetting, chest pains, etc. The charitable mental health advisor mentioned, risk condemning a generation of children to a lifetime of mental and physical health (Sanchez). While some doctors were able to diagnose the condition, others could not find a suitable term to describe their sufferings and what they were forced to witness. Dr. M.K Hamza, a neuropsychologist with the Syrian-American Medical Society (SAMS), came up with a new term to describe their condition as devastation (Morley). He mentioned that in a family of 5, 6 or 10 members, only one 2Children in the district of al-Bab, in Aleppo, 6 March (Sanchez). Elsingergy 3 survives, and the child has to live the rest of his/her life without a caring parent (Morley). Is not that enough to scar a future, past and present? After seeing two examples of the difficulties Syrian children have to live with, one might ask, how can I help? What can I give? Although some may suppose that help can only be provided financially, this assumption is completely erroneous. Help can come in various shapes, depending on the financial condition, geographical location, education, job, etc. For example, a student might not have the financial capability to donate to charitable organizations. However, he/she might have the capability to visit a refugee-helping organization in his/her city, and help the children refugees by teaching them English. As a matter of fact, help can sometimes be just a form of psychological support, given by spending time with children, listening to their innocent stories, offering them a friend they never had a chance to know and being there when their lives get depressing. Another form of help may be to raise awareness amongst the circle of acquaintances by providing them with background on how the children are suffering. Finally, if one does not have the time or capability to physically help the children, then the least he/she can do is to remember them in prayers. Syrian children deserve to live, dream, smile and live their lives as children. Hence, why not help them do so? Why not help provide them with their basic human rights like, food, education, health care, shelter, love, etc.? In fact, there is much everyone can do, and it is never too late. If you are willing to return back the Syrian smile, donate at www.childrenofsyria.info. They provide winter clothes, health care, psychological support, shelter and sanitation facilities. Together, we can help save a doomed generation of lovely and hopeful children. Elsingergy 4 In conclusion, children have nothing to do with politics, religion, and these adult-world complications. As a matter of fact, all they understand about is family, friends, toys, etc. Hence, they deserve the right to live their lives normally. The picture on the left was taken by the United Nations International Emergency Fund (UNICEF), when they asked a bunch of Syrian children about their dreams. She innocently said, want to live in a big house that has room for all my family and (Manocchi). Hence, people should try as much as possible to help them achieve their simple dreams and wishes, which war and conflict have deprived them from. Elsingergy 5 Works cited Costello, Tim.
