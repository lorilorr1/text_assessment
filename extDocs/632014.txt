Thorne 1 Colten Thorne Professor Aranda ENC 1102 February 5, 2017 Is Standardized Testing a Necessary Evil? It is the goal of the U.S department of promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal It is foolish to dispute the fact that all major education organizations aim to lead students to be successful in school. These organizations often differ, however, in what they believe is the most effective way to educate students. Currently, the United States public education system operates primarily as a means of preparing students to pursue a career through college education. Through this philosophy of college preparation, a system of high-stakes, standardized testing has emerged. The implementation of standardized testing has many legitimate and practical uses in the education system, however, many people argue that by its very nature, standardized tests cause problems for the education system and must be removed or reformed in some way. Those who argue for the removal or reform of the standardized testing argue that evaluating all schools, teachers and students using one single criterion is unfair and something must be done to change this. Both of these people believe that theirs is the best way to educate students and I will use this commonality to propose a meaningful and effective compromise between the two. The first stakeholder I have chosen is The College Board, the purveyors of the SAT. Being the administrators of one of the largest college entrance standardized exams, they are strong supporters of standardized testing. College Board is a mission-driven not-for-profit organization that connects students to college success and Unsurprisingly, the Thorne 2 mission statement of The College Board echoes that of the education system, the organization aims to prepare students for a successful college career. Not only are standardized tests use to evaluate admissions into colleges, but they can be used to ensure various levels of the education system are getting students educated to the proper standards. They can also be used to evaluate the proficiency of a instruction or to aid policy makers with data so they can make more effective and informed decisions. All of these benefits attest to the usefulness of standardized testing in the education system. In contrast to The College Board, my second stakeholder, FairTest, argues that standardized testing impedes the advancement of quality and equal opportunity education. National Center for Fair & Open Testing to end the misuses and flaws of standardized testing and to ensure that evaluation of students, teachers and schools is fair, open, valid and educationally The non-profit organization argues that these tests are an unfair method of evaluating students, teachers and schools. Teachers and students are now being assessed based solely on these standardized exams, a trend FairTest calls stakes Because of this, teachers have begun to to the teaching only what the students will need to know to pass these tests, stifling creativity in the classroom. This lack of diversity in the curriculum has caused classes to become narrower in scope, again creating a lack of creativity in the classroom. I have heard many teachers say that standardized testing, though it is flawed, is a And while I agree that some benchmark must be established to ensure proper education of students, I think this necessary evil must be necessarily evil. I believe a system can be implemented in which standardized testing is still present, but less weight is placed on them regarding the evaluation of students, teachers and schools. FairTest has undertaken the task of attempting to get more colleges to make the taking of standardized tests Thorne 3 optional to the admission of a student. This should be implemented throughout most, if not all, colleges so as to deemphasize the importance of high stakes tests such as the ACT and SAT. Having the option to not take the test and still be admitted into colleges based on your other grades, skills and attributes would greatly increase diversity and creativity without hampering academic quality within a college. Standardized tests will still be used to assess students, teachers and schools, but to a lesser extent than is currently being implemented. We can further and more accurately evaluate by focusing on the classroom. Using things such as research projects, oral presentations, essays and problem solving, we can evaluate a student more broadly rather than just being judged by their test taking abilities. A teacher will not get rated by their ability to teach only information needed to pass a test, but by their ability to teach other skills necessary to having a successful college career. Standardized testing will still be implemented at schools, but students will have the option not to take the test and that, should they choose to opt out of the testing, their admittance to universities will be assessed on their other merits such as grade point average and volunteer work. Finland, currently rated as having the second best education system in the world, uses this system of teacher observation, documentation of student work, and performance-based assessment, all of which involve the direct evaluation of real learning tasks. While the implementation of this proposition would require cooperation from a number of stakeholders, not just FairTest and The College Board, I believe that this, in concert with standardized testing would yield an extremely effective education system that would propel student to a successful career path, whether that be through college or not.
