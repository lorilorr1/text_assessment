Jordan Gill Murray ENC 1102 26 February 2017 Childhood Exposure to Violence Shapes Violent Behavior Have you ever heard the saying that children are like sponges? This statement is actually true. In an article by Maureen Healy, an author who writes about how to raise children, states brain is incredible sensitive to external stimuli as it wires itself in response to his or her environment. This plasticity means children are like sponges soaking up their environmental cues and (Healy). This begs the question if children act similar to the situations that they are surrounded with. For instance, if a child is exposed to more violent situations and violent media, does the child develop a more violent nature? One main source of violence today is from video games. Granted, not all video games are bad. Some develop young learning and problem solving skills, while others help with spelling or the alphabet. However, too much violent videogames can be hazardous to a child. According to Gregory Fritz, founder of the website American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, of children exposed to violent media have shown that they may become numb to violence, imitate the violence, and show more aggressive behavior. Younger children and those with emotional, behavioral or learning problems may be more influenced by violent (Fritz). This allows for children to act violent and think it is ok because it is what they are around. An example of this is the kid from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. He was playing a violent video game in the opening scene and was later shown as disrespectful to his parents and depicted as having a violent personality. source: http://www.express.co.uk/celebrity-news/637654/Charlie-and-the-Chocolate- Factory-s-Jordan-Fry-as-Mike-Teavee Another source is from the type of community a child grew up in. According to researcher Eunju Lee, a child is constantly surrounded with arguing parents, cussing, and community violence, they are more likely to exhibit similar This explains how children are like their parents when they are older. Another researcher, Joy Osofsky, developed a research experiment that shows that children to household violence as children develop posttraumatic (Osofsky). The impact of violence in the media and in situations on children is astonishing. It corrupts a child into thinking violence is natural and allows them to think violent actions are okay. There have been multiple cases in which children have harmed others, such as when a year-old boy brutally killed a 6-year-old girl by imitating professional wrestling moves, the Columbine High School massacre, carried out by two adolescents who had practiced their plan by playing violent video games, and a 17-year-old setting himself on fire while being videotaped in an attempt to duplicate a stunt as seen on (Gentile). If parents limit their exposure, the child can develop a more well rounded mind through educational games and situations than develop a violent personality through video games.
