Student Dr. Gaspar ENC 1102 16 April 2017 SeaWorld: A Force For Good Animal conservation has been a hot topic issue in recent times. With the creation of documentaries such as the public has become more aware of animals that are kept in captivity and have begun to express a sense of displeasure with organizations that hold animals in captivity. SeaWorld has felt the brunt of this wrath; seeing losses posted within their theme parks and backlash from the public and state governments. However, what many fail to realize is that, although they do have animals in captivity, SeaWorld plays a large role in the world of animal conservation and is one of the leading research institutions and animal activist organizations. By examining the work that SeaWorld does, one could be shown that they are a leader in animal rescue and conservation. By recognizing this, one could also be shown that they should care about the continuation of SeaWorld conservation efforts due to the fact that, without them, there will be a large void in the animal conservation community that cannot be filled by another company of equal or greater size. Lastly, some may feel a call to action by getting involved in education others on the misformation a falsehoods that surround SeaWorld and their conservation efforts. By recognizing these three items, one could become more informed in the role that SeaWorld plays in animal conservation and understand the need for captivity in order for the greater good. Within the realm of animal conservation and captivity, there has been a large amount of misinformation and falsehoods spread by those who have an extreme view of the concept. This type of view has caused SeaWorld to suffer major setbacks as the general public has accepted some of these ideas as fact; when in reality, they are far from the truth. One of the major critics of SeaWorld and creator of this falsehoods has been People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). PETA has created a vicious marketing campaign against SeaWorld in order to discredit them and mark them as cruel to animals. Their website, SeaWorldofHurt.com, states that SeaWorld sea animals to tiny and that their animals prematurely from stress and other (SeaWorldofHurt.com, 2017) In examining this site, a viewer would be able to see several attempts to persuade its readers without providing evidence. The first being that they do not use any verified sources or credible material to cite in their sources; nor do they provide tangible evidence showing wrongdoings by SeaWorld. They depend on soundbites of whales in distress and disturbing pictures, however do not state where or when these pictures were taken place and if the park was owned by a SeaWorld entity. In addition, many of their statements are not supported by major organizations that monitor the health and well-being of animals within captivity. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums, or AZA, has continued to grant SeaWorld with accreditation and has awarded them with their Quarter Century award, which highlights wildlife organizations that have met the demands of accreditation for twenty five years or more (SeaWorldCares.com, 2016). Surely, if these problems were as prevalent as PETA states, the governing body over zoos and aquariums would find fault with SeaWorld and demand that they change. With misinformation being spread, despite the continued support of the AZA, SeaWorld has gone on the offensive and created their own website, SeaWorldCares.com, to combat website. In this website, SeaWorld presents their mission statement and describes their overall goal and contribution to the world of animal conservation. They have also displayed their current accreditation and public statements of support by experts within the field. Compared to website, it contains more works from verified sources and attempts to place a more educated response rather than one that relies on creating an emotional response. It is important for the audience to see the difference, as SeaWorld plays a much larger role in animal conservation than PETA does, as evidenced by the different messages that their relative sites portray. By seeing and understanding the difference, the audience becomes more educated on the topic and can identify the falsehoods that PETA portrays as fact. The reader can also identify the much larger role that SeaWorld plays in the realm of animal conservation, as listed by the many rescues and rehabilitations present on their website. As PETA attempts to discredit and blame, SeaWorld chooses to showcase their work and allow the audience to decide. To the reader, this can show the vast difference between the two companies and how SeaWorld is a leader in their field. Once the audience acknowledges the vast role that SeaWorld plays within the animal conservation community, it stands to reason that they would consider what would be the consequence of SeaWorld disappearing from the field. As showcased by their website, they participate in the rehabilitation and rescues of animals worldwide. However, without the funding that they gain from theme park sales, SeaWorld could begin to downsize their efforts, which may result in more animals being harmed from lack of resources and knowledge that SeaWorld brings to the table. One of the most prominent works attempting to discredit SeaWorld has been a documentary which attempts to showcase SeaWorld as an organization that separates animals from their families and forces them to perform. However, Michael Scarpuzzi demonstrates that this is untrue in this article Film Ignores Benefits to Conservation, Scarpuzzi shows through this article the contributions that SeaWorld makes to their field and the potential repercussions that could be suffered if we allow the mistruths of to be presented as fact. The audience is made aware of the impact that SeaWorld has and educated on their importance to the field. It is also important, as Scarpuzzi notes, that SeaWorld does not force their animals to perform; a mistruth that attempts to parrot and portray as fact. By realizing the impact that SeaWorld has and the void that would be left if they were to disappear from the field, the audience would be able to grasp that this is a reality that cannot be allowed to exist. These two points lead the audience to the most important point of all: how to take action and support SeaWorld in order to prevent them from caving under to pressure from organizations like PETA. Some may feel that they must be involved hands-on in order to make an impact. But, SeaWorld makes it clear that their audience can have an impact from home if they are not able to volunteer hands on. They provide educational material that showcases their latest work and the research they they are currently participating in (SeaWorldCares.com, 2017). This allows the common audience member to be involved from the comfort of their home by combating the spread of misinformation with the spread of facts and evidence. Not only does SeaWorld provide material to combat website, they also provide material to point out many of the falsehood presented in This allows to common person to spread the information, which will allow SeaWorld to gain favor within public opinion and attempt to repair the damage that has been done by misrepresentation and falsehoods. In conclusion, SeaWorld has proven themselves as a leader within the realm of animal conservation and welfare. However, some organizations have attempted to discredit them by promoting information that intentionally misleads their viewers and draws on an emotional response rather than an intellectual one. However, the audience must stay engaged by being educated in the falsehoods presented against SeaWorld and the facts that combat them. Once these have been identified, the audience can understand the void that will be left if SeaWorld disappear from the world of animal conservation and how to combat and fight for them to remain relevant.
