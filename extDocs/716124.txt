Gass 1 Darren Gass ENC 1102.910s17 Kristin Gocinski 4/21/2017 To Live Forever: Should It Be Done? Throughout millenniums kings and emperors have strived to live forever. Ponce De Leon came all the way to Florida from the new world searching for the mythical fountain of youth in his quest to live forever. Many people want to live forever, they imagine themselves becoming old, having a hunch back, being in pain. This is not the goal this paper is promoting, the goal is to increase the time you are healthy and not in pain, to increase health span, not lifespan. Throughout this paper, trying to live forever and increasing health span are the same goal, they are accomplished by doing the same things and reap the same benefits. One organization that can benefit from increasing their health span as long as possible is the World Food Programme or WFP. Their mission statement is to emergency and economic & social These can be done with trying to living forever. The WFP and every single person can help meet emergency needs and support economic and social development by increasing their health span as much as possible through manipulating their bodies with science. The average person would not think that eating healthy would result in feeding the poor, but it does, even if you personally feed the poor. When one does not eat healthy they develop diseases, and need to spend a whopping amount of money on medical bills. As an example of how costly disease can be is that the cost America wastes to treat chronic pulmonary Gass 2 heart disease is a crazy $50 billion dollars annually(Guaraisco). This $50 billion would be better invested in businesses which would grow the economy at a faster rate. A better economy faster means technology comes out faster, and people have more resources to put into feeding the poor and developing social and economic development which are the goals of the WFP. Now that it is clear that not increasing your health span leads to disease, and disease leads to a large part of the economy being wasted, how can health span be increased? There are very specific actions to be taken to increase health span. First examine why people age in the first place. Telomeres are at the end of DNA strands and they act as janitors for the DNA helping maintain it. Every time a cell separates it must re-create a new strand of DNA. length has been associated with aging and disease. As we age, telomeres become shorter and shorter until the cells die or transform into oncogenic cells. Short telomeres have been linked with cancer, heart disease, and (Shammas). Knowing this telomere length is a good indicator as to how old someone is. What causes telomeres to shorten? Free radicals which are formed by radiation and they tear apart the insides of our bodies specifically the telomeres. Luckily for people, antioxidants reduce the amount of free radicals in the body which keep telomeres long and cancer to a minimum (Shammas). The easiest, most convenient, and surprisingly delicious way to get antioxidants in your diet is through green tea(Lambert). Besides anti-oxidants there are other changes that can be made to the diet to increase health span as long as possible. Diving into some ancient Japanese knowledge we get the saying until only 80% this saying comes from Okinowa the city with the longest lifespan in the world(Mishra). Caloric restriction has even been scientifically proven to increase lifespan in mice and monkeys. In mice it increased their lifespan on average of 10%-20% (Weindruch). Debatably the healthiest food besides antio-oxidants is salmon, due to omega-3 fatty acid Gass 3 content. However salmon is rather on the expensive side, so the cheaper it is the more salmon people will it. A very interesting study found that marketing of genetically modified (GM) salmon will lower salmon prices and increase consumption of will prevent between 600 and 2,600 deaths per year in the United (Tucker). This shows how effective salmon is at preventing death and increasing health span. These have all been changes to diet, but what other things can be done to increase health span? It is common knowledge the benefits of physical exercise, but the benefits of mental exercise can be almost as great. Who has a sharper mind, a 20 year old college student, or a 60 year old Tibetan monk who has been meditating for 5 hours a day his entire life? Science would probably say the monk. One study examined how the brain aged in mediators and it found no decline in mental performance as the meditators aged control subjects displayed the expected negative correlation of both gray matter volume and attentional performance with age, meditators did not show a significant correlation of either measure with (Pagnoni) Does this mean meditation can completely halt the mind from ageing? In some ways at least, yes. The mind is like a muscle, it will deteriorate if it is not used, and will be susceptible to fatal diseases like Another way to increase grey matter and size of the brain is juggling. A study found that consistent juggling increased brain size and mental strength, and if stopped the brain would shrink. So with consistant juggling and meditation, the brain can be just about completely excluded from ever deteriorating, increasing health span. This has all been how to live longer, but how is the jump made to live forever? This is all hypothetical because no one has even lived past 125 much less then forever. The most practical and least science fiction way, is through nanobots. Nanobots be possible until atomic manufacturing and computing is possible, but they would go into our bodies and fix all the Gass 4 damage that has been caused by ageing. Another way is by preserving DNA when young and telomeres are still short in a laboratory. There are a few things that can be done from here to live forever. One thing that can be done with the DNA of your younger self is to be combined with stem-cells, and then injected into the body. It is like injecting yourself with your younger self. The second thing that can be done sounds impossible, but keep in mind up until 50 years ago it was thought that heart transplants were impossible. It is that if you have DNA preserved from a younger version of yourself before the telomeres were shortened and mutations piled up, you can clone yourself and then do a brain transplant into your younger self. The final way it would be possible to live forever, is if we could download our consciousness to computers. Some scientists believe this can be possible by 2050. In summation it was proven that increasing health span as much as possible would improve save trillions of dollars worldwide which would lead to social and economic growth, which are the goals of the WFP. Some people will read this article and make excuses like just wait for the life extension discoveries and technology to come Well the life extension technology and discoveries have already come out we just need to utilize them. Let me point out a profound statistic, from 1901 to 1991 the average life expectancy went from 45 to 75, but only estimated to go from 75 to 77 from 2020 to 2020 (Turner). How is the rise of average life expectancy slowing down when the rate of technology and discoveries is going up? It has nothing to do with technology and everything to do with the choices people make. It is proven that Americans are getting fatter (Cutler). make the poor choices most Americans make, make the choices that will increase your health span well beyond 77 years of age. Utilize the discoveries and technology gone over in this paper and implement it into your life and live long and climb mountains into old age.
