But the bigger issue is that the DEA, the agency responsible for all drug problems in the U.S.A still considers Cannabis as a Schedule 1 drug, which means that they think weed is more addictive than other drugs such as Cocaine and Methamphetamine. These are considered Schedule 2 drugs, even though there are several research pieces that prove that Marijuana is not only less addictive than Cocaine and Meth, but also proves that it is less addictive than other licit drugs such as Alcohol and Nicotine. On the bright side these last couple of years have been good for the legalization movement, lots of data has been gathered, data that proves that the drug is not as bad as people think.
