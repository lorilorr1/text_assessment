Mitvalsky 1 Cullen Mitvalsky Professor Carr ENC 1101 March 26, 2017 Historiographic Essay: Assisted Euthanasia After analyzing multiple articles, and reading from personal accounts on the opinions of assisted euthanasia; whether it be from ill patients or healthy, have concluded that people feel there should be a right to choose life or death in time of suffering. Between 2011 to 2017, the scholarly conversation has remained pretty stagnant for the most part. The only drift in opinion was when a group of seven healthy, senior individuals were surveyed and did not know much about the topic of assisted euthanasia. Even then, individuals felt that those suffering should have a voice. I will be further supporting these claims through the presentation of studies, interviews of individuals by the authors, as well as providing quotes directly from the patients and individuals themselves. In the qualitative study done by Chapple et al., their results found that after interviewing multiple people, they saw that UK law should be changed to allow assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia was felt strongly by most  The results of the narrative interviews also showed that, those who had seen others die were particularly convinced that this should be a  In a Dutch hospital, it was also found that patients wanted complete control of when and how they spent their final days. A young woman, who named, had a chronic obstructive lung disease. When asked about her opinion on the subject of assisted euthanasia, she said that without a change in law she may commit suicide  Throughout her time being interviewed, she Mitvalsky 2 stressed her right to having control and choosing when she wanted to end her life. The authors Chapple et al., prove their credibility by providing multiple narrative interviews, as well as giving visual analyses through tables that displayed backgrounds and characteristics of the 18- total people discussed within the scholarly article. In a cross-sectional study covering Dutch health care, Ezekiel J. et al., made a selection of patients whose death was non-sudden and who were older than 16 years of age, because of our focus on whether or not requesting for  In the study, the authors found that of patients who did not die suddenly, 7% of these patients explicitly requested for  The majority though, roughly two-thirds of these patients were denied their requests. To put it into numbers; in previous years, out of 260 requests for euthanasia, only 80 were granted. Euthanasia requests that were granted, seemed to only be limited to those whose deaths were sudden and expected. Therefore, if you were battling serious, painful cancer, you would be denied your request because your illness would take longer to kill you. The study also concluded that four out of ten times, requests for euthanasia met because the patient died before they were granted their wish. How would this be fair to those who passed away without having any say in how or when they died? Ezekiel J. et al., prove their credibility through multiple tables listing all the characteristics of patients interviewed, and showing the number of requests for euthanasia based on the characteristics of the individuals. Seven interviews were conducted by Lamers et al., to get the opinions and views of older citizens on the subject of assisted euthanasia. The results of the interviews found that some of the participants felt confused and  The participants said that assisted euthanasia is a family issue and that they articulated a strong sense of  No one wants any family member to pass away obviously, so they felt that they would hold onto life for as long as Mitvalsky 3 they could. These discourses could have been formed through external forces though, such as a result of their developmental phase or  The patients also lacked a sense of knowledge on the issue of euthanasia which may have been the cause of the confusion and confliction. Death and suicide are taboo and uncomfortable subjects, so understandable as to why they may be uninformed. Although the interviewed individuals had this lack of knowledge and were conflicted, an alternative discourse of dying outside the medical gaze  Participants who were in favor of assisted euthanasia felt  and made it apparent that there were double standards in the debate on allowing euthanasia or not. They made claims that the anticipated dependency on poor care from (professionals) others, made participants consider assisted euthanasia/suicide as ways of avoiding this stage of life and the associated loss of  Lamers et al., proves their credibility through tables listing their interview questions as well as providing scripts of what the interviewers answered. Also, providing a table that lists all seven participants by name and giving relevant characteristics towards the study, such as marital status, profession, health and spiritual life. The article This Is No Way to  is a true story by Shannon Proudfoot. It follows the story of a woman named Ruth Duffin who is suffering from disease. Ruth, along with her husband Richard and daughter Shelly, fought continuously for right to choose euthanasia leading up to her death. From what Proudfoot writes in the article, there were numerous reasons as to why Ruth wanted to end her life. Ruth felt that over time her loss in independence and having hardly any value of life made her want to die. Due to the increasing nature of her disease, Ruth reached a point where she would much rather pass away then continue to let her disease wither her away any further. Ruth states, For many years, I was able to manage as the disease gradually whittled away at the things I held dear. I am now at the Mitvalsky 4 point however, where there is nothing I look forward to except an end to my suffering. I have gradually lost all of  Ruth wanted to be able to end her suffering so badly, and have a say in her death, that even though law prohibited assisted euthanasia, she contemplated taking her life by her own hand. daughter Shelly states, we have much time, my mom is talking about how she wants to step in front of a  Ruth desperately wanted the option of assisted euthanasia. To do this, they had to fly from Canada all the way to Switzerland where it is a legal practice. It does not devalue your life that my mom has an opportunity to be able to humanely end  daughter ends with this powerful quote showing how the rights and wishes of the ill and suffering are important, and should not be undermined because of the opinions of others. Proudfoot is proved credible because the article is a true story about Ruth Duffin and her family. Mitvalsky 5 Sources Cited Chapple, A., et al.
