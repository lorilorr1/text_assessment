von Werder 1 Jade von Werder Ms. Poston ENC 1102-069 26 February 2017 Rhetoric Analysis of Stop the Hunt Campaign Images In 2015, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation (FWC) issued a hunt to kill 320 black bears in certain areas of the state. Like many other animal hunts, there is typically a group of people who protest this course of action and fight to save the targeted animals. In the case of the Florida black bear, a nonprofit OneProtest campaign called the Florida Bear was created as a result of the controversial hunt. This campaign has a goal of spreading awareness and educating citizens to prevent any further hunting of bears in Florida. In order to effectively gain support and spread awareness, the campaign sells merchandise as well as posts frequently to their Facebook page in attempt to gather a larger following of people to get behind their stance. One bumper sticker sold by the campaign is an image of a bear cub with its mother and the words, shoot my mom, save Florida This image uses pathos and logos to get the audience to understand why shooting bears is not okay. Another image this campaign uses to appeal to Florida residents is one found on their Facebook page. They utilize a statistical fact that communicates that Florida bears have not killed a single person. This image appeals to logic and credibility to show that there is no reason to lethally hunt bears who have not done any lethal damage to humans themselves. By exploring and analyzing the visual rhetoric in these two images, one can see how this campaign uses rhetorical appeals to persuade their audience to consider their viewpoint. von Werder 2 With a growing black bear population in Florida over the past 30 years, human-bear encounters have become more frequent and have been escalating to more dangerous situations. Aside from the most common interactions involving bears getting into residential trash, bears have also been reported attacking pet dogs and injuring people. Responsible for the control and management of Florida bears, the FWC decided to issue the 2015 hunt in order to maintain the bear population that has been causing all of these problems. Stop the Hunt believed there was a better way to go about dealing with the bear problems and that the FWC did not listen to the majority of the public when it came to deciding if the hunt was necessary. As an effort to prevent a possible upcoming hunt in 2017, Stop the Hunt has been reaching out to more Florida residents in attempt to get more people to speak out against hunting bears. It is not enough to just state on their website that the 2015 hunt involved violations of the hunting regulations with cubs and lactating mothers being brought to the weigh par.1). Aside from exploiting where the FWC mismanaged the 2015 hunt, this campaign has been creating persuasive visual protest content to convince citizens that Florida bears need to be saved. One visual rhetoric medium this campaign adopted was the use of bumper stickers to promote their protest. shoot my mom, save Florida is what one particular sticker reads along with a picture of a bear cub and its mother (see fig. 1). This image conveys the baby point of view by asking readers to not shoot its mother. The purpose is to get the audience to understand that these bears have families and shooting a bear could take away a mother from her cub. This is a tactic to appeal to emotion, also known as pathos. While visually seeing the picture of the baby bear, the audience can empathize with the cub and feel that shooting a bear means ripping apart a family and making this bear cub an orphan. This is also a use of logos. von Werder 3 Many people hunt all sorts of animals from ducks to deer, for sport or for food, and do not seem to have a problem with it. What this image does though, is put the hunting of bears from a perspective of taking away a mother. People will more likely support this campaign if they can logically see that hunting bears means taking away a mother from its baby rather than just for sport or population control. As stated on their Facebook page, Stop the Florida Bear Hunt opposes hunting of bears because they have yet to see any scientific evidence that it is acceptable to hunt bears. They said that there is no other reason, other than for a trophy hunt, to be killing bears in Florida. They do not believe that is what conservation is about. This post is accompanied by an image that states in large bold letters the following fact: bears have killed 15 people in 116 years in the lower 24 states, and not one death was in (see fig. 2). The purpose of sharing this image on their Facebook page is to get regular Florida resident Facebook users to see that bears have not been a lethal threat, which is a common reason to hunt certain animals. This is an appeal to logic and provides the audience with factual evidence to reason with. This image also uses ethos by not only stating a fact, but also including the source where the fact was pulled from- study published in the Journal of Wildlife (see fig. 2). This shows that the campaign is using a credible source to back up their point of view. Appealing to credibility on top of logic creates more reason for Florida residents to agree with and support this campaign. Through using appeals to emotion, logic, and credibility in their protest merchandise and Facebook posts, Stop the Hunt has been able to gather a following of people who support their opposition to hunting bears in Florida. Their Facebook page, for example, has over 72,000 likes and over 4,000 people talking about them on Facebook (Stop the Florida Bear Hunt). Using images of real bears, especially cubs, are effective pathos appeals. The use of logical facts are von Werder 4 sufficient for audience members who may not be able to emotionally relate to the situation. The efforts in producing visual rhetoric will hopefully aid in their mission to galvanize Florida residents to speak out against bear hunting when it comes time to decide on the potential 2017 hunt. von Werder 5 Works Cited Fig. 1.
