Kellman 1 Abraham Kellman ENC 1102.003 Dennis 16 April 2017 Physician Assisted Suicide: Dignified death or Homicide? Brittney Maynard was a normal woman, a newly wed, and a happy dog owner all until the new year of 2014 came around. For months now, Maynard had been suffering from incapacitating headaches, so she decided to go to the doctor to get it checked out. Well, she was diagnosed with brain cancer and her life went from trying for a family to going in and out of hospitals. She had final gotten two surgeries to remove and stop the growth of her tumor and everything seemed all right. Then a few months later, the cancer came back with a vengeance. She was prescribed a full brain radiation treatment, because the tumor was so large, but the side effects were so drastic and debilitating her life quality would be gone. She looked for a cure and other treatments that would sustain her quality of life, or a fraction of it, and found nothing. She then considered hospice or palliative care, but she was young and her body could hold out for a long time, and even develop drug resistant pain. Finally, as a last resort she looked into death with dignity, or physician assisted suicide (PAS) . After understanding that nothing else was going to lead to a quality end of life, she decided that this was her best option. So, she uprooted herself, moved to Oregon, and went through the long and tedious process to qualify for PAS. Many people are like Brittney, they have no other option that will end in a non-painful and or degrading death than PAS. Organizations like death with dignity believe that people who are terminally ill and mentally stable, should be able to have the option of PAS.
