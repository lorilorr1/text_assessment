It is critical that we lower funding on Planned Parenthood/Family Planning clinics because they offer crucial services that people rely on for survival. Services like Pap smear tests, cervical cancer screenings, STI testing and treatment, abortions, etc. to everyone but especially low income women. -people rely on these clinics for survival b/c of all the services and how they cater to lower income people -poverty rate among women w/ access to contraceptives is lower -people against these clinics are against contraceptives but mainly abortions- abortions are such a small part of what they do, also you can be personally not agree with abortions but other people should be able to choose whether they want to or not -
