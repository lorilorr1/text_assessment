Box 1 Hannah Box Emil Smith Composition 1 - Section 2 3/5/16 The Discussion on Home Education and Academic Success in College American institutionalized education was established to create academic success and prepare students for college, but is it questionable whether formal education is the only way to accomplish this goal. Home education is an alternative form of schooling that began with controversy in the 1960s (Riley 11) and with over two million children being home educated in the United States today (Riley 12), it is considered a popular education option. People have questioned the ability of homeschooling to prepare students to be academically successful in college since it began becoming a popular schooling option in the 1990s. This research on home education and academic success in college began in the early 2000s, which was around the time when homeschooling was beginning to be normalized. This research covers recent studies as well, taking advantage of the scholarly data that is available as home education continues to grow as a schooling option. Scholarly discussion on this topic had not necessarily changed, but as research on home success at creating academically successful college students increased, the stigma against it was diminished and informal forms of education became more accepted. This is a relatively new topic of scholarly discussion and continues to grow. In the early 2000s, there was a mix of biased, opinion-based scholarly discussion and research was being conducted to disprove these biased statements. There are multiple articles published during this time period that attempt to devalue home educated students as people who are unable to be proper citizens or be successful in regular society. An example of one of these Box 2 biased articles is Rob Civic Perils of (2002). This article reflects a lack of knowledge about homeschooling and is simply a biased opinion without any data to back it. Reich states that a child must attend a public school to experience enough diversity to be a good citizen, because it is a duty to respect the fact that others may have different opinions or beliefs from their own and still consider them equals (58). Another issue with home education that Reich mentions is that home educated students can often feel like outcasts because they did not have the shared experience of attending public school that most people have had (58). Published only four years later (in 2006), Michael H. article The Common Myths About  questions statements. Romanowski takes many common myths about homeschooling at that time and uses various studies also published in this time period to disprove them. One of the myths that Reich mentions, that homeschooling fails to prepare good citizens (Romanowski 126), is debunked by Romanowski. The author found a study by Brian Ray (who surveyed 7300 homeschooled adults) from 2003, that found that home educated individuals were very active in their communities, with 71% of homeschool graduates actively participating in community service (compared to 37% of US adults) and 88% of homeschool graduates being members of a community organization (compared to 50% of US adults) (127). The other Reich finding, that homeschooling produces social misfits (Romanowski 125), was also debunked by Romanowski. He states that it is based off of the assumption that school is the only time and place a child socializes, and it ignores the efforts that many homeschool parents put in to ensure that their children are being social through extracurricular activities. (125) Although there was a great deal of biased discussion during this time period, there were also many people debunking those myths and showcasing positive data towards home education and collegiate success. Box 3 From 2010 to present day, there have been multiple studies specifically focusing on home education and academic success in college that positively reflect homeschooling as a viable form of education to prepare students for college. The first study that specifically tackled this topic was in 2010 by Michael F. Cogan. Exploring Academic Outcomes Of Homeschooled  revealed that home educated students often score above average in academia and sparked the discussion about home education and academic success in college. This study analyzed the academic outcomes of home educated, Catholic school educated, and public school educated students at a doctoral institution in the midwest. It found that the homeschooled students scored highest on all fronts tested - average ACT scores, high school GPA, first-year GPA, four-year GPA, and graduation rate (Cogan 23). This study was the one of the first of its kind, and others have followed suit since. An Evaluative Study Of The Academic Achievement Of Homeschooled Students Versus Traditionally Schooled Students Attending A Catholic  by Marc Snyder (2013) also tested the academic achievement of homeschooled students, but they attended a Catholic university in southern Florida. The study shows that on average, homeschooled students scored higher than both public schooled and Catholic schooled students on all fronts tested - average ACT scores, SAT scores, college GPA, GPA based on major, and core GPA (Snyder 301). Both of these studies use definitive data to show that homeschooled students often are above average when it comes to academic achievement in college. Even though definitive data on academic success has become more prevalent in recent years, people are still studying the traits of good citizens in homeschooled students. Differences In Competence, Autonomy, And Relatedness Between Home Educated And Traditionally Educated Young  by Gina Riley was published in 2015 and compares the world Box 4 of home educated students and traditionally schooled students. The test found that homeschooled students scored higher than traditionally schooled students when it came to competence (the mental capability to do something successfully) and autonomy (independence) (Riley 17). Home educated students scored around the same as traditionally schooled students when it came to relatedness (ability to work with others) (Riley 18). The combination of study and studies such as the ones by Cogan and Snyder give a comprehensive understanding of homeschooled students and on average, their ability to be academically successful and engaged citizens as adults. Although this topic of scholarly discussion is still relatively new, there does seem to be a trend: as knowledge of home education increases, so does the positive discussion about this form of schooling. The general opinion on homeschooling has become more accepting and there are more studies backed by data (rather than just opinion) in more recent years. The positive discussion about homeschooling and academic success is reflected by the millions of people homeschooling in America today - and successfully attending college afterwards.
