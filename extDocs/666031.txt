Donovan 1 John Donovan Noah Pearlstone Composition 2 2/26/17 Project 2: Intermediate Draft Since the days of sending our men and woman to battle began, more and more discoveries show how it can be a great struggle to try and readjust back into civilian life. Many men and woman who come back from war are at risk of developing PTSD or post-traumatic stress disorder. This is a condition that can persistently stress your mental and emotional self due to being exposed to certain events that have caused psychological shock. Some results of having PTSD can be disturbed sleep, constant vivid recall of a traumatic experience, and dulled reponses to others and the outside world (National). The PTSD Foundation of America is a non- profit organization dedicated to mentoring veterans and their families who suffer from PTSD. They believe it is our duty as Americans to help these warriors adjust to finding their new normal (Our Mission). To perform this duty, the PTSD foundation of America uses the rhetorical appeals of ethos, logos, and pathos through a selection of images to help make a push for public support and awareness in the battle to beat post-traumatic stress disorder. Ethos is the common practice of trying to deliver a message by appealing to a ethics by having a credible messenger (YourDictionary). The PTSD foundation of America does exactly this in both of the images selected. In the first image, ethos is visible in the manner that the name of this credible foundation is clearly displayed in the center of the image. By displaying their well-respected name right in the middle, they increase their overall credibility of their image. The same tactic is used in the second image. They again realize to appeal to ethos, they include their Foundations name in the image. If these two images did not include the words Donovan 2 Foundation of the viewer might not recognize how important these images are and will not seek to make a difference or seek to learn more about those suffering from this condition. Just like ethos, both images adequately display the rhetorical appeal of pathos. Pathos is an appeal to emotion, and is a way of convincing an audience of an argument by creating an emotional response (YourDictionary). Pathos can be seen specifically in the first image in the patriotic color scheme, along with the image of the shield to increase the patriotic look. This patriotic look shows outsiders looking in that this is a patriotic foundation and tries to increase their feel/obligation to learn and to help those who suffer from PTSD. Being a patriot does not mean you have served in the military, many people in the civilian world are still patriots and will have feelings evoked by this patriotic look the image has and will recognize that this can be their way of serving their country. In the second image, while they do not use patriotic colors, they include a star as another representation of the stars and stripes and patriotism. They also use specific words to try and trigger a optimism to make them feel they can make a difference. They use the terms and which gives a feeling that no one is alone. Without the inclusion of these words, someone may look at the image and think this seems like a good cause, I cannot do anything to help fix this problem, I am only one This is the reason the developers of the image were sure to include specific attributes in the image that will appear to pathos. The last rhetorical appeal used while creating these images was logos. Logos is a rhetorical appeal that appeals to a logic to tries to convince them to do something through reasoning (YourDictionary). While the second image does not have any characteristics that are made to appeal to a logic, the first image does have one specific characteristic. Donovan 3 This logical characteristic is the inclusion of the phrase hope and healing for the unseen wounds of This phrase provides a brief description of what PTSD in a way that everyone can understand. Everyone knows that war can cause many injuries to a human so its showing how this is a specific, unseen injury that cannot be looked past. It provides a statement assuring that by following up on this image, you can provide the hope and healing that these veterans need to overcome PTSD. This logical definition of PTSD and proof that you can truly make a difference is why this image can be considered using the logos appeal. Without the logical appeal this phrase gives, the viewer may feel lost on what PTSD is and what to do next to help heal anyone. PTSD is a traumatic issue in America. It is seen that almost 30% of veterans come home to suffer from PTSD (NIH MedlinePlus). This has led to an average of 20 veterans committing suicide each and every day (Times). That is why the PTSD foundation has been created to try and bring a voice to the problem. They have found great success in doing this through Images that can grab attention through the rhetorical appeals and can make a push for public support and awareness in the battle to beat post-traumatic stress disorder.
