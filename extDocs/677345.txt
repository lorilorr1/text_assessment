Good 1 Jonathan Good Instructor: Brenden Jackson ENC 1101 03/09/17 Intermediate Draft Throughout history, there have been many viewpoints and discussions that have changed. The effects of music in the medical field is one of them. It has changed from being a more tongue-in-cheek form of thought to yield no real conclusive a more respected field of experimentation. Before 2011, the most prevalent experiments conducted in this field were on how music affected the development of children and how it was suspected to cure childhood diseases. Flash forward to the present; experiments conducted on how music affects the brain in the medical field have grown a tremendous amount. Experiments now range from the medical use of music in mentally ill patients to the medical use in the physically ill. From 2000 to 2010 the number of experiments conducted on the topic of the medical applications of music were few and far between. In the year 2010, an experiment was conducted to see how music affected the recovery of a patient with refractory nonconvulsive status epilepticus (coma). report a remarkable response to music in a patient with refractory nonconvulsive status (Kuester, and Rios, and Ortiz, & Miranda). Even though most experiments conducted on this topic between the years of 2000 and 2010 yielded no conclusive Good 2 result, this one did, making it an exception to the otherwise common outcome. Another test on the medical effects of music was conducted in 2009. The test specifically focused on music as medicine in school-aged children during their stage of post-operation. medicine reduced the requirement of morphine and decreased the distress after minor (Stefan and Ulrica Nilsson, and Kokinsky, and Sidenvall, & As seen, the experiments conducted between the years 2000 and 2010 were very specific on top of already being scarce. From 2011 to 2017, the research and experimentation on the medical applications of music have grown exponentially. In 2014, an experiment was conducted to determine if music could lessen the strength of (interictal epileptic discharges) in epileptic patients. who listened h a day showed greater improvement in focused attention and verbal memory than patients who listened to audio books or received no listening et al.). A paper was written in 2011 about the emotional foundations of music as a pain killer. It discusses the effects of music as a pain killer in therapy, post-operation, and pre-operation. inclusion of music or rhythmic, melodic speech with medical treatments has a long history and frequently has been used to promote and maintain health as well as to alleviate (Bernatzky, and Presch, and Anderson, & Panksepp). As displayed, the experiments conducted between the years 2011 and 2017 were much more vague and applicable to a good number of normal citizens. Overall, the differences in the experiments conducted in years between 2000 and 2010 versus the experiments conducted in the years between 2011 and 2017 vary greatly, in fact, they are opposites. In the years between 2000 and 2010 there were few experiments. Even then the experiments were conducted on specific demographics. In the years between 2011 and 2017 Good 3 there were many more experiments conducted compared to the amount conducted between the years of 2000 and 2010. The experiments were also performed on a much vaguer demographic. In conclusion, music is emerging into the medical field more than ever before. It has changed from 2000 to 2010 and 2011 to 2017 yielding progressively more and more vague and universal results. If the advances with music in the medical field keep growing at this rate then there may not be a need for a good number of over-the-counter drugs in the future. Eventually music could help ease the symptoms of minor diseases.
