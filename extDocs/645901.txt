Cherilus 1 Christina Cherilus Ms. Theodosiou ENC 1102 1/29/2017 The Death Penalty Compromise Last year, approximately 20 prisoners were executed, the year before 28 prisoners met their fate, this is only a few of the total one thousand four-hundred and forty-five people in the US whom have lost their lives due to executions since 1976 (DPF). Capital punishment is a very controversial subject today due to being very sensitive and divided. Many organizations believe capital punishment to be a very inhumane and an old practice that needs to be removed. The Rights Watch organization is a non-profit organization made to defend the rights of people worldwide, they also pressure those with power to respect rights and secure justice. They believe that the death penalty is a violation of a rights and fight constantly to get it to be abolished. rights watch) On the same topic others feel that capital punishment is a way to bring justice to the sinister and heinous acts done by a certain few. The state of Florida is one of the many states in the US where the death penalty is still in practice. Many representatives in the state believe the death penalty to be a form of justice. Although these two may not agree completely there is one common belief shared by them. They both strive for the rights of a subject. The Humans rights watch believes in the rights while representatives of the State of Florida believes the rights. Because the HRW wants their subjects to be represented and given the rights to decide, and Representatives wants their victims to receive justice in one form or another. The prisoner on death row should be given an alternate. The Cherilus 2 prisoner on death row should be given the choice of the death penalty or solitary confinement. This allows the subject to pay for their heinous act and both stakeholders get a fair part of what they worked for. Americas Humans Rights Watch organization was founded in 1981 during the civil war (History HRW). Focusing on rights globally, the HRW classifies themselves as a nonprofit organization consisting of about 400 rights professionals. They are guided by international rights and humanitarian law and respect for the respect for the dignity of each human being (About HRW). Similar to Kouroutakis, the HRW believes that killing someone is murder whether it is done by a person, or officer of the law therefore the capital punishment of an offender fits the crime of murder (Kouroutakis 43). Making this the issue with the State of Florida where capital punishment is still active. The State of Florida, like many others have continued the practice of the death penalty. Various representatives have various to why, such as former Mayor Ed Koch who claimed that the death penalty And that by failing to execute murderers, he says, we a lessened regard for the value of the (Ed Koch) Others believes that the death penalty reduces the amount of killing due to fear and therefore should be kept. (Anckar 15). Just like rights groups contends that need the death penalty because evil 2) Now to the compromise, to please both parties while making sure that they are both being represented. An explicit example will be given with several outcomes to demonstrate the way in which the compromise will work. Beginning with real life example of murder cases, with or without found killers, the compromise will be explained systematically. It is not often that a murderer gets trialed with the death penalty, it is rather popular with serial killers however. When a murderer or serial killer is trialed with the death penalty, he or she should be given an alternative. Cherilus 3 Depending on the crime at hand the alternative may differ slightly. Solitary confinement will always be the alternative however the sentence may differ in length depending on the crime. If a prisoner is charged with capital punishment for the murder of a person, to devise an alternative sentence, the case must be reviewed and classified. Depending on how the murder occurred, meaning if the victim was tortured, raped or mutilated the sentence will be longer than if the victim was not. If there were multiple victims, the sentence will be longer with respect to each victim. If there were children the sentence would also lengthen. The way that this would be settled is if the immediate families of the victims got to help decide how long should the sentence last. A set length would be given but it could also be altered by the immediate family of the victim(s). For example, the Black Dahlia has been one of the biggest mystery murderers in the united states. Elizabeth murderer was never found and brought to justice. Yet the murder was very brutal, leaving her body almost unrecognizable. If the killer was to be found, due to the brutal torture of body it would be likely that he or she could be given life or the death penalty. If trialed for the death penalty, in point of view, the rights are being taken away. Therefore, the killer would be given a sentence of solitary confinement instead. If the alternative seem to please the immediate family, they will have the power to extend the sentence but never reduce it. If there are more than one victim the time will lengthen accordingly and each immediate family of the murdered victims will have the power to extend the sentence to a certain limit. These sentences will begin with 10years of solitary confinement to life depending on the crimes and cases. It may come across as a ridiculous alternate to many yet in fact it may be classified as worse than death itself. Humans are social creatures, staying alone for a long period will slowly but surely lead the subject to an unstable mind and shattered humanity (Williams 1). The way that solitary confinement benefits the family is that they get to see Cherilus 4 the murderer pay the price of their human nature if not their minds for the irreplaceable life of the victims themselves. HRW cannot go against this compromise because the killer is given the choice. They are not forced or manipulated into picking, they will be explained what to expect when put into solitary confinement. They will be kept separate from every other prisoner, will not allowed to talk to any others found in the same state however they will receive monthly checkups to make sure that they are still mentally aware. Representatives of Florida will not go against this compromise because, it is a way to bring justice to the families and at the same time they will be saving money from the possible executions and could use it to benefit another region of the prisons. This can also benefit the state and the prisoner by reducing the chance of executing innocents. It has occurred in many cases where the subject whom was executed or sent behind bars was actually a victim. However, if we think some innocent people have been executed, that by itself is not a sufficient reason to abolish the death (Stichter 141). Once again showing the need for an alternative. This may not be a permanent resolution to the issues residing between HRW and the many representatives of the state of Florida however it is suitable to last a long time. Making sure both parties are well represented. In the end, the rights watch wants the prisoner to keep his or her human rights by being able to make their own decision, the representatives in the state of Florida wants justice to be passed and wants the victims to be well represented. The compromise will intertwine both sides by giving the subject the decision to which sentence he or she prefers between the death penalty or an appropriate solitary confinement sentence to make sure that justice is being pass while his or her rights are being respected.
