Jachimek 1 Ben Jachimek ENC 1102.910 Professor Gocinski 15 February 2017 Nuclear Family: Transition to Nuclear Energy The energy production sector is capable of emitting over seven billion metric tons of carbon and sulfide emissions each year (Sims 1322); this amount of hazardous pollution would be able to fill over a billion large dump trucks. Carbon and sulfur emissions do not only destroy the environment, but can also pose as a major health risk to humans. Tampa Electric Company (TECO), and the Global Environment Facility (GEF), are at odds over this problem. TECO is the sole provider of the bay electricity and the GEF works to tackle the largest environmental problems. Although these two organizations have different goals, they do hold a concern for the environment and preserving it. TECO has already been attempting to make environmentally conscious decisions, but the changes it has made thus fare are negligible. TECO can dramatically increase its energy output and reduce carbon emissions if it begins to produce nuclear energy. TECO provides energy to nearly 350,000 people, and energy is unquestionably the most important part of modern infrastructure; it allows hospitals, police stations, and many other vital assets of daily life to function properly. TECO is the sole provider of electricity in the Tampa Bay area, one of the larger metropolitan areas in the state of Florida (TECO 1). primary goal is to keep the lights on for its customers, and to continually meet demands as the local population and city expands. This is a tall order, as J. Henderson discusses in his research that Jachimek 2 urban growth can accelerate drastically once certain population marks are hit (Henderson 303). This shows that TECO needs to continue providing quality service to its customer base, which will only continue to grow. With such a demand and inefficient coal and gas facilities to work with, TECO may eventually reach a point where they struggle to meet energy demands and construct a number of new facilities to keep up with urban expansion. This would result in a drastic increase in the price of energy and greater amounts of local air pollution. On top of this, TECO has already been attempting to reduce their carbon footprint by making their plants more efficient (TECO 1). So now TECO is tasked with upscaling their electricity output while trying to make environmental damage minimal. The Global Environment Facility is an organization who uses investment strategies to not only help the environment but to reduce poverty and promote equality between men and women. The organization has been active for nearly 25 years and is still working hard to keep the planet preserved (GEF 1). The conglomerate is primarily focused on reducing environmental damage and would most definitely protest methods and vision as a whole. The GEF has sound logic when prioritizing the environment, as Douglas Dockery conducted a study across six U.S. cities to find a correlation between different types of air pollution and their effects on health and mortality. His study found a positive correlation between air pollution and mortality, especially when sulfides were present in air samples (Dockery 1756). The primary byproduct of burning coal for energy is sulfur dioxide, and not only is this compound hazardous, but it is a small enough particle to inhale and absorb rather easily (Dockery 1757). The issue is, with the growing energy industry, the background levels of sulfides and nitrates in the atmosphere can cause a global decrease in life expectancy if something is not changed. This is why the GEF is working Jachimek 3 hard to reduce global carbon and sulfide emissions, to hopefully stop this problem before it turns into a disaster. Luckily these stakeholders have some common interests and similar ideals. With a recent flare in research and environmentalist movements, TECO is now working to be more environmentally friendly, thus giving both stakeholders a new common objective. For TECO, there is a simpler way to accommodate the metropolitan evolution than increasing the efficiency of their power plants and opening public preserves. By adding a nuclear reactor to their production facilities, TECO could almost double their production output while producing a fraction of the waste. This would allow them to be more than prepared for a population influx, cut down on costs to fuel their facilities, and also satisfy the goals of the GEF. Unfortunately, a lot of factors will need to be taken into account for a reactor to be constructed. First off, most people would be unwilling to live close to a reactor, meaning TECO will need a remote area for the plant. This could also present an issue as Florida is known for its unstable limestone and marshy areas. Next, nuclear reactors are very expensive to construct, but once built they are cheap to fuel and operate. Finally, reactors still produce waste, and nuclear waste is an incredibly vexatious form of waste to process and make safe for disposal. Fortunately, these hurdles can be overcome with one simple solution. TECO needs to wait for new reactor technology to be developed. Ralph Sims published an article that compares all forms of energy production and gives some insight into each. When he discusses nuclear energy, he talks about the South African company ESKOM, who is working on advanced reactor designs that can do everything from using depleted fuel to being a fraction of the cost to build (Sims 1317-8). This is where the GEF could help, by backing what ESKOM is doing; this will help expedite the research. The GEF is a very large, international organization. They could help Jachimek 4 expedite the development of this technology by simply expanding the work they are doing in South Africa to include energy production, and therefore the company ESKOM. With these new reactors, TECO will be more than ready to accommodate a huge population boom and drastically reduce hazardous emissions, as nuclear power plants avoid carbon emissions of 600 Mt=year compared with using coal-fired plant to generate the same quantity of (Sims 1318). This reduction in emissions would correspond with the ultimate goal of environmental protection. Also, one the technology is developed, TECO probably be the only energy company investing in this. possible that this revolution could cause a wave of companies to build reactors and drastically reduce dependence on fossil fuels. The answer to growing energy demands and harmful pollutants has been around for many decades. Unfortunately, this technology still has some maturing to do before smaller energy operations can afford to buy and operate their own reactors. In conjunction, the GEF and TECO could help make a difference in how electricity is made and consumed, and how its byproducts impact the surrounding populous. If they set the example and contribute to the streamlining the complex processes involved in creating nuclear energy, they could possibly even revolutionize electricity production for the world, and help put an end to air pollution simultaneously.
