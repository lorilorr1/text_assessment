Grajales 1 Angelica Grajales ENC 1102 Bianca Hernandez February 26, 2016 Intermediate Draft There are more than 5 million Americans living with disease. This disease is the sixth most common cause of death in the United (NEWSWIRE). Millions of people are suffering from this disease and do much about it, most of them have support from their families and people who love them. There are many organizations that provide services to families dealing with the disease to better help them cope; one of those organizations is the Foundation of America (AFA). The AFA is an organization that helps the people dealing with the disease and help their families. The mission of the AFA is to provide optimal care and services to individuals confronting dementia, and to their caregivers and families through their member organizations dedicated to improving quality of life Foundation of America ). By using advertisements from there website and through the use of the rhetorical appeals ethos, pathos, logos, and Kairos they are able to ensure people that they are there to provide the best care and support the families going through this difficult time and in the end give them the proper treatment the patients deserve. The AFA wants to prove to their audience that they truly care about every single one of their patients. They do that by appealing to pathos in their advertisements. Pathos is the way an image evokes emotion and the first image does this in an effective way. The first image shows a heart with the logo from the organization and two hands cupped together are holding that heart. Grajales 2 By having the hands holding the heart it shows the organization cares for our wellbeing and will do what they can to give their patients the best care possible. The image also provides a teal background and by using color you are appealing to emotions because color is a powerful tool that can change our mood and finding the right color is key to having the audience interpret the image how you want them too (Kaminska). Image two provides a figure of a head with the words trying to hovering over the brain. Having the words rearranged around the image is referred to as typography and typography is great for enhancing a theme and demonstrating emotions (Schneider). The text, together with the head exemplifies the effect the disease has on the brain and proves that the organization wants to help the people dealing with it. Both images provide the website at the bottom of the advertisement along with their logo which adds to their credibility. By providing the link they appeal to ethos, the credibility of information, and provide a way for the audience to search for further information and verification. In addition to providing the website image one also provides their toll-free hotline in case the audience wants to donate or gather more information. By providing this information the audience trust the organization and makes them seem more trustworthy. The presences of ethos in these images makes the organization automatically more trustworthy to others. Without logic and reasoning most organizations would not be able to grab the attention of their audience with their ads. Logic and reasoning is what is known as logos and the AFA implements this appeal into their advertisements. The first image displays three words big and bold in red which directly grabs the attention of the audience and makes it easier and more logical to them. It displays the key words care, which is exemplifying what the AFA is all about. Having these words in red can represent the color of a heart by using Grajales 3 colorful, and artistic text they are evoking a great advertisement tool and catching the attention of their audience thus showing logic (Schneider). Also, the background of the image is in teal which is the color for and brings forth to light that the organization is all about treating The second image is just as logical. The image provides a head as the center and focus of the ad, there is no face just an outline of a head and surrounding the head are a bunch of words, sentences, and phrases all clustered together and the main point is the sentence trying to hovering right over where the brain should be. Having thoughts clustered together and trying to remember certain things is the effect of disease thus the ad is proving to be logical to the audience. As previously stated is the sixth most common cause of death and unfortunately this deadly disease has no cure. Overtime people with the disease lose their memory more and more and makes it harder for them to communicate with others, thus limiting the time families have with each other. This aspect of time refers to the rhetorical appeal Kairos which both images use very well. Image one state much referring to Kairos but provides information to donate which shows the AFA continuously takes donations and hopes that they will eventually find a cure but until then they are taking care of everyone one person at a time. The second image provides different thoughts and phrases which resembles the fact that the disease causes you to have confused thoughts and shows that the disease progressively gets worse and worse over time. disease is not something to just brush off the shoulder, it is a serious illness that effects a lot of people. Because there is no cure people who have the disease are forced to suffer through the mental and physical pain as well as their families. A person that they once knew who had so much joy can barely remember who they are now. For that reason the AFA is Grajales 4 there to give the proper care to these patients and give them the proper treatment as well as helping the families cope and making them more aware of By providing advertisements that use the appeals pathos, logos, ethos, and Kairos, the AFA is able to effectively persuade their audience that they are an organization that cares.
