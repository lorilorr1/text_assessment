The animal rights groups want everyone to just eliminate the option of meat altogether due to the fact that it is all unnecessarily using up land, water, and energy, while destructing wildlife, rainforests, and the oceans. Peta has been around for years spreading the message and informing citizens about where their food comes from and how the production of it affects the planet, health, and the animals involved. Therefore, they are credible and so their logo on the bottom corner of the ad adds trust and reliability. The image is trying to capture the attention of the viewer by making the picture very gruesome. They purposely used human arms and legs that have been cut off so that the viewer They almost want to scare and disgust the audience out of eating meat by showing blood and associating it with dinner. The logos of the image are not that apparent because there are no statistics, facts, or graphs to indicate that they are appealing to logos. The statement gnawing on flesh turns your stomach, why not go gives a sense of urgency.
