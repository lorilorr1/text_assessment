Garcia 1 Haley Garcia Professor Gocinski ENC1102.012 27 January 2017 To Juice or Not to Juice: Steriod Abuse It takes less than five seconds to find steroids on the internet. This fact leads to the realization that ultimately anyone has access to these drugs, which in turn leads to an increase in steroid usage. It is easy to see why many individuals are drawn to the idea of these products, ads issued on the internet constantly portray these buff men and slim women as the type of individuals who use these products. This manipulation completely disregard the negative aspects and health issues that are common with steroid use that are ultimately life threatening. The Federal Drug Association is one of many accredited companies who fight against steroid use and abuse by portraying to the public real consequences of taking these drugs. This stakeholder establishes evidence that steroid use only leads to negative health effects that could essentially end up killing you in the long run. This mindset is portrayed through a variety of ads that are published by the Federal Drug Association that steroids are not a good choice. One of my images has Jesse Ventura, a professional wrestler who had attempted to use steroids to help his career, but quickly realized they were not for him. The other image has a young athlete, specifically a football player, falling to the ground with the words mean These two images use Ethos, Pathos, Logos and Kairos to draw people in and establish the idea that steroids negatively impact your body and are not worth the risk. Establishing a connection through ethics, empathy, logic and time helps people establish a connection or the ability to recall the meaning Garcia 2 later in life regarding the negative effects of steroid use. Although these two images are not the most empathetic ads, they do provide an impact on those who see them and are easy to relate to. The two images effectively prove the Federal Drug Association is against steroid use and wants all people to feel the same way. Federal Drug Association says no in regards to steroids. Over the past hundred years they have established many laws against the use of these products because the risks are more prevalent and dangerous then the desired effects are on the body. Some effects listed from anabolic steroids range from fertility issues, higher blood pressure, heart, and liver abnormalities. This is only a few of the issues that have developed in people who use or abuse steroids. The fact that steroids are so easily distributed, either by the internet or people getting prescriptions for growth hormones and selling them to others for a profit. This easy access has increased the use of steroids rapidly in the past decade. The Federal Drug Association has taken a multitude of steps to change the ability and reputation of steroids. They have found illegal distributers online and taken them down, these sites often send out fake prescriptions or fake products to buyers. Stopping this illegal process is going to take years and a lot of people to take these companies down. The FDA is responsible for protecting the public health by ensuring the safety of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, and medical devices. They do this by deteriorating the reputation of steroids and a variety of other products to maintain a healthier atmosphere for everyone. The appeal Ethos essentially convinces the viewer of something through using a celebrity or some other source of credibility to persuade them of the issue at hand. The first figure I chose is the one with Jesse Ventura, a professional wrestler, actor, author, naval veteran, and political commentator. His accomplishments and broad spectrum of careers allow him to appeal to a Garcia 3 variety of audiences. Also for the people that know of his accomplishments, they would associate him with knowledge, or at least enough experience to relate to. The quote on the poster makes the reader want to believe him because he says that he has done this before so he is reliable and experienced with the use of steroids and its negative effects. It is easy to correlate professionals or celebrities to being trustworthy because their lives are in the hands of the public, making them seem open and not able to lie. The other Figure I did was the one with the boy playing football. People have often heard or have read of the negative health effects that correlate with steroids. That being said, seeing this young football player fall to his knees makes people feel a sense of credibility and confirmation of what they have heard before. Also, at the bottom of the poster it states the facts on the back of the when the readers see this they automatically connect the word facts with credibility. Pathos, associated with emotions, convinces the audience by directly creating an emotional response. The image with the Jesse Ventura, the celebrity, makes the readers laugh at his stern expression and feel a sense of anticipation. Most see his face and hand and associate it with needing to pay attention or importance. Reading the quote on the left side of the post, they will feel sympathetic towards him because he has gone through negative effects from the use of steroids. Anyone who has gone through health issues or has known someone who has been Garcia 4 effected by steroids will feel like they can relate or sympathize. The second poster I chose with the football player falling makes people feel sympathetic because he is young and should not be having health issues that he seems to have in the image. The fact that he is grabbing at his stomach on the ground in pain makes the viewers worry and want to do something to help the boy. This emotional connection establishes a bond with the readers to the poster and will make them not want to go through the same thing he is living through. This negative reaction to the ad helps make the idea that steroids are a negative thing more obvious. Logos, the appeal that deals with logic, persuades the audience by giving reasons to avoid steroids. The image with the celebrity, Jesse Ventura, persuades the audience that if this guy has done steroids and it went badly they should probably not use them either. The idea that one person has gone through negative issues with somethings directly establishes the idea that if it happens to them it will probably happen to me too. The poster with the football player falling to the floor persuades the reader that if this young athlete is suffering from using steroids I probably will too. Just like the first image, both ads make the viewers associate negative consequences with using steroids. The idea that what it does to you, will also happen to me is a large part in both of these ads. Kairos refers to the timeliness of an argument this type of persuasion pertains to the thought that you have to be at right place at the right The image with Jesse Ventura, the celebrity, uses time by saying he used to use steroids butt has stopped because of the negative effects. Also, the quote establishes that that was the past and he is a healthier, better person now then he was back then. The second poster with the football player falling appeals to time because the image starts off with him running confidently, however as time continued he gradually fell to his This correlation to time is seen within both of the images above. Garcia 5 The first image is with Jesse Ventura on the front, uses a celebrity to help establish credibility. The position he is in adds a sense of humor to the ad and the quote next to him gives the reader insight on how he feels about steroids. The fact that you are looking at him and the fact that he is holding a weight makes it seem like getting in shape or buff is possible without the use of steroids. The toughness in the picture gives off that the purpose of the ad was to tell people that steroids really do not help in the long run. Also, that you can get bulky and achieve the goals you have by just working things out. The second image portrays a football player falling to the ground. This represents the that steroids cause athletes after using them. Also, people can relate to this ad because football is a major part of the American culture and establishes a deeper connection with the audience. The man in the football uniform is also a younger guy considering he is playing football so the audience would feel sympathetic for him because he is younger than the general population. The purpose of this ad was to associate youth without steroids and that the average person will live a lot longer without using them. In conclusion, the FDA tries to warn people that using steroids will only affect them negatively in the long run. These ads use Ethos, Pathos, Logos and Kairos to draw people in and create the idea that steroids are not worth the risk in the long run. Using ethics, empathy, logic and time establishes that not only are these ads entertaining to look at, but they also contain information that is important to remember. The reason the Federal Drug Association has developed such a strong opinion on steroids is because their main focus is to keep our society safe and maintaining our public health. Anything that goes against this is argued and fought against. Garcia 6 Works Cited Steroids Mean  U.S. National Library of Medicine.
