Student 1 Student L. E. DuBois ENC 1102 05 March 2017 Join the Boycott of Food Waste, Not Late Student 2 In society, more and more people pay attention to conservation and environmental protection. The topic that is food waste also has entered the attention. People can find the problem of food waste in the anywhere and anytime. Such as, leftovers of home or restaurant and expired food of supermarket. People often have leftovers in home or restaurant, and supermarket also has to throw away a lot of food, because they are not sold before safe data. People and businessmen spend money to buy them, and they also have to pay it to deal with them in the last. This is a vicious circle in the society. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is an organization of American government. Their purpose is giving people healthy and safe food, and they also prevent food waste (USDA). They put in a variety of related plans and activities to keep people in the ranks of food waste. For example, they had the plan that it is named compost, it plans using the professional machine and leftovers to make the soil that is helpful to crops. This plan reduces the cost of food waste. Walmart is an American large international supermarket chain company. Their purpose is saving people money and giving people better food. In order to achieve the purpose of their company that is people save money and get better food, they purchase a lot of food. But not all sold, because of the shelf life there are a lot of food was thrown away, resulting in a lot of food waste. About stopping food waste, this is always the primary goal and objective of U.S. Department of Agriculture. In the near future, the USDA has two plans and actions. The one is compost, the other is U.S. Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champions. In the first, the compost can deal with leftovers better. Compost is a basic ally that gives  to your soil naturally. The USDA have the machine to use leftovers to make the compost. Firstly, USDA classify the trash cans and let people know what food can produce compost, garbage collection stations can collectively deliver these food waste to USDA specific department. Then workers Student 3 classify these leftovers once again, they use the machine to process these leftovers. In the last, they can get the compost, and putting it in the earth can make crops better and healthier, and people also can get food that will be better. On the other hand, the USDA have the action that called U.S. Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champions. In November 2016, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) decided set up action of the U.S. Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champions group (USDA). Many businessmen and organizations joined in this action and they have made a public commitment to reduce food loss and waste in their own operations in the United States by 50 percent by the year 2030 (USDA). Because the USDA and the EAP think a lot of amount of food waste in the United States would have negative influence to food security, resource conservation and climate change. And the government alone cannot deal with this problem, it need to more businessmen and organizations to solve. The Walmart company has a good purpose, save people money and give people better food. But in order to achieve the purpose of their company that is people save money and get better food, they purchase a lot of food. But not all sold, because of the shelf life there are a lot of food was thrown away, resulting in a lot of food waste. The one supermarket of Walmart can be produced so many food garbage. Such as, doughnuts and pastries, stalks of still-crunchy celery and bags of bright plump oranges. Even if it sounds like the shopping list, it was all in garbage (CBC). Walmart prepared a lot of good food to buy for people, because of too much food, the kind of food cannot bought by people. When they over the safe date, the food would throw away. The Walmart throw out so many food every day. While staffers found bins full of food at some Walmart locations, other chains had compactors making it impossible to see what they throw out (CBC). Student 4 The U.S. Department of Agriculture hope people stop food waste, but there is the big company wasting food every day. Maybe the leader of Walmart knew the severity of food waste. The Walmart company is one of member in the action of the U.S. Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champions group. They would commit to reduce food loss and waste in their own operations in the United States by 50 percent by the year 2030. This is a good decision for the Walmart and people. Walmart can restore the negative image of food wasting in minds, and it also can have less cost in the deal with expired food. This makes Walmart have better expenses in the accounting, and stockholders also will stand by this action. By the way, Walmart also can introduce the compost plan Or two organization get the cooperation to deal with expired food. The Walmart can cost less fee to deal with expired food, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture also cost less to get these. The U.S. Department of Agriculture use these expired food to make compost to let farmer have better croppers, people also can get better food in the market. The tow organization can reduce costs and losses, and they can deal with this problem well in the society. In the end, food waste is a serious problem in the society. People also pay more and more attention to this problem. These two organization get many plan and ideas to solve this problem, such as, two plan of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and action. So there must be more organization attention to this problem and will have more and more solution to solve food waste problem. To help galvanize national efforts to reduce food loss and waste, it will require effort and action from the entire food system. In a word, the whole society should pay close attention to the problem of food waste. Only in this way can get the better life in the future. (1107) Student 5 Works Cited Campus Kitchens Project.
