Melanie TeMaat April 16, 2017 Mr. Phillips Composition II The Vast Benefits of Veganism In society, one could say that animal cruelty is a hot-button issue. The ever-growing concern with animal mistreatment has only continued to grow. The recent footage from the movie, seems to show trainers forcing a dog into turbulent waters has received immense criticisms from the public. Animals rights have become a big conversation in society, likely prompting the ever-growing vegan movement. Not only does being vegan entail respecting animal rights by abstaining from all animal products, going vegan also benefits the environment and has many health benefits. Even if you may be one of those people who care about what they eat, remember that being vegan is more than being healthy, but also saving animals and the environment. The most prominent and well-known benefit of going vegan is definitely the health aspect. Turns out, the high intake of fresh fruits and vegetables and the absence of animal products proves to be very beneficial to health and overall wellbeing. A study being conducted by Ornish and other co-investigators shows that a low-fat, near vegan diet is very beneficial to health. They surveyed 85 men with 65 of them dealing with early-state prostate cancer. The split the group into two, one half following the low-fat vegan diet and the other receiving normal care from their physicians. Over the years, the vegan group has nearly doubled their fiber intake, and also greatly reduced their fat intake. In addition, they also showed a significant increase in vitamin and mineral intake. Essentially, the study found that eating a near-vegan diet can increase the the amount of disease fighting components, while also decreasing disease causing components such as cholesterol and saturated fat (Mangels). Although the study has not yet been completed, it is evident so far that the diet is having a positive impact. Vegan diets are notorious for increasing antioxidants and fiber in the body, while also reducing saturated fats and cholesterol, which over time, can help prevent disease and cancers, such in the case of the study being conducted by Ornish and co-investigators.
