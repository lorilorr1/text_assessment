Alyse Dixon Roth ENC 1101-003 9 April 2017 Throughout the past couple of decades, there has been a great push for equality in America. This is including the way Black people are treated when they are accused/convicted of criminal behavior. The specific conversation is surrounding the War on Drugs. In the 1970s and 1980s, a new drug problem started in America. Many poverty stricken places were ridden with crime, drugs, and violence. In 1971, President Nixon first introduced the term, declaring drugs to be public enemy number 1. It progressed when, in 1982, President Reagan officially declared a war on drugs. There has been a huge outcry because of new evidence and accounts of how the War on Drugs has actually been used to hurt the Black community instead of helping America. Though there are still many people who think that the War on Drugs has actually stayed on track with its original plan. Although there are those who believe that the War on Drugs is a benefit to America, there is evidence that clearly suggests how harmful it is to the Black community. Firstly, the War on Drugs is very harmful to family life for Black Americans. There has been many instances of Black men being sent to prison for a drug related charge. It has become a horrible cycle. Men and women are being sent to prison over drug charges and they are missing out on their own lives. It has become a norm for black children to grow up in single- parent homes, their fathers away in prison for long spells and barely knowing them. In poor and working-class black America, a man and a woman raising their children together is, of all things, an unusual  The drug war plays an oversized role in this (DeRugy) Black men are being taken away from their families at astonishing rates due to the War on Drugs and all of the subtle racism coupled with it. Originally, the War on Drugs was thought of to be an operation to help the poverty and drug ridden cities in America. Instead of eliminating that issue, a new one was created- mass Alyse Dixon Roth ENC 1101-003 9 April 2017 incarceration. 1980, for instance, there were fewer than 300,000 people in prison. By 2000, however, that number had risen to over 1 (Bobo 449) There was an almost 400% increase in a drug charge resulting in prison time. There were and still are many minorities going to prison for non-violent drug charges. for marijuana possession, usually for very small amounts, account for 44 percent of drug arrests nationwide and disproportionately affect African Americans. Although few have been sentenced to long prison terms, most acquire criminal records that will handicap them for (Graff 120) The Black community is being subjected to its own destruction at the benefit of the government. The War on Drugs has also only made the already strained race relations in America worse. With America attempting to move on from the Civil Right Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, this only added fuel to the fire. Stop and frisks were utilized by police in the 90s. Soon, people began to realize that it only happened to minorities. and frisks proliferated in the United States during the War on Drugs, particularly in impoverished predominately Black and Latino  (Cooper 1188) This connects to the present because of all of the recent cases of police brutality towards Black people. Before it was blatant discrimination and now it has become much more subtle and unnoticeable. There are many that believe that the War on Drugs has been a positive thing for America. There are those who say that it has helped bring drug users and sellers to justice for breaking the law. Prohibition of drugs has put almost 3 million people in prison. That is almost one-in-five from the prison population. There are more people than ever behind bars for drug related charges. Another goal of anti-drug policies is to interrupt the supply and demand chain for drugs. Alyse Dixon Roth ENC 1101-003 9 April 2017 This operation has done the complete opposite, it has only pushed the drug chain underground. Making it even easier for the access. In conclusion, the War on Drugs has done more harm than anything else to the Black community. It has created even more problems than what already existed. It is helping to hurt the Black family, increase prison rates for Black men, and strain the ever-tense race relations in America. Though there are some who believe that it has helped America, there is evidence that shows the opposite. Alyse Dixon Roth ENC 1101-003 9 April 2017 Works Cited 1.
