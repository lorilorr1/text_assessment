Morgan Reinhardt March 1, 2017 Martha Heiser Legalization of Euthanasia The controversy over euthanasia has been a long battle between morals, dignity and death. Dealing with the United States only some states have made the steps and legalized euthanasia. The organization, Dignity in Dying Campaign, is strictly focused on legalizing euthanasia in the United States. In the first visual there is statistics on the passing of euthanasia in Oregon, these statistics are of data after sixteen years of having euthanasia legal in their state. This first image is trying to portray the effects of legalizing euthanasia. As for the second image this is portraying a man hooked up to wires and machines with a women by his bed side with a comic bubble over head stating: suicide is just not a Both images have the same purpose which is to persuade the audience to change their thoughts against euthanasia which would result in the legalization of it. While both images have the same purpose, they convey that purpose in two very different ways. In the first image logos is the major rhetoric used but kairos is also utilized.all of the statistics and numbers are helping to show the audience the effects of legalizing euthanasia. And the use of the data being taken over seventeen years shows the significance and accuracy of the statistics. This image takes into account the audience that is concerned that legalizing euthanasia would be a domino effect of other problems. To pursuede this audience the use of statistics would be most effective, it allows them to look at data from a state in the United States that has had legal euthanasia for seventeen years. As McCarthy, the author of Euthanasia outlines all the hurtles a patients has to go through to even be considered for euthanasia. A patient must ask for the prescription three times, two of those times being spoken, there is a 15 day waiting period and the patient must be competent and terminally ill with six or less months left (1). This is only the beginning of the other regulations the patient must do to complete the euthanasia process. Through these extensive rules for euthanasia Oregon becomes the perfect platform to show the rest of the United States. This first image uses statistics like calls to extend the and 500 have assisted to portray that the effects of legalizing euthanasia after seventeen years are not negative but exactly as they should be. Some people though are less concerned with the after effects of legal euthanasia but more concerned with the moral justification. Contrary to the first image, the major rhetoric of the second image is generally pathos with some ethos and kairos applied to it. The ethos and in this image is very subtle because if you know what your looking at it have much effect. In the upper left corner there is a television with a man who looks like he is being interviewed by the press and at the bottom of the television it says out of Kevorkian was a physician who was also an euthanasia activist, he was sent to jail for illegally euthanizing his patient, Mrs. Adkins who had Alzheimers. This case took place in the before euthanasia was know as widespread as it is 1). This important piece of the image could also show kairos, it shows the timeliness of the image and also the appropriateness of having it in the image for a campaign to legalize euthanasia. Having this image also gives credibility to Jack Kevorkian. As for pathos the image evokes a ton of emotion. The man lying in the bed is hooked up to machines and skinny also looks as if he is already dead, while the women on the side states how euthanasia is unnatural all while being completely oblivious to the condition the patient is already in. This scene evokes emotions of sadness and discomfort. The audience may feel sadness for the man in the bed because he is withered down to nothing but is still alive, and discomfort for the patient as well for imaging being hooked up to so many wires and machine just to keep his heart beating. This image is a strong campaign photo because the audience is looking at the inevitable truth of what terminally ill patients last months look like. The photo highlights that euthanizing is as unnatural as a machine keeping you alive, the only difference in euthanasia is more humane. Further analysis of these images can uncover much more important information. In the first image the color scheme is limited to two colors a vibrant pink/red and a light blue. The blue is used as a base color its main purpose to draw attention to the pink/red colored things. everything in pink/red despite the illustrations are numbers, when the audience sees this image their eye will immediately go to those numbers. This is important for this image because it contains so much information that if it all was the same color it would be overwhelming to look at and it would be overlooked. Making the numbers pop in a vibrant color is what makes this image so effect. As for the second image there is more visually to analyze. To start the background of the image in a blank white, this reminds me of the so called that everyone is suppose to walk into when they die or it could even represent heaven. The blankness of the background also brings attention to the ending on the mans life, there is nothing to look forward to but his death. Moving on to the most significant visual is the man laying in the hospital bed. He seems to be very pale and extremely skinny almost making him appear already dead. The only thing that confirms he is alive is his open eyes and the heartbeat reading on the machine. Another critical thing is his air mask it takes up his entire face, in fact taking a first glance at the photo the audience would be more drawn to pay attention to the machines rather than the man. I think this brings insight to how people view euthanasia. So many times people are worried about the unnaturalness of euthanasia or keeping the person alive but they pay attention to the patient and what they want. The women at the bedside even paying attention to him but seems to stand firmly against euthanasia. Is legalizing euthanasia a big enough deal to make such an uproar about it? The Oregon image highlighted that only 1 in 500 people even used euthanasia and an outstanding majority of the people that did euthanize were in hospice. The second image not only confirmed that euthanasia is natural but so is the machines that help a person survive, which bring attention to a bigger problem in the treatment of patients. But euthanasia being legalized isnt for everyone, not a bad thing if a majority of a state does euthanized and its not a bad thing if they do. The point of legalizing euthanasia is give a person full medical right over their own body. Euthanasia should be readily available for a terminally ill person if that is the only medical option left, and the person should decide not the law. ! !
