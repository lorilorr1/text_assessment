Shephard 1 Victoria Shephard Professor Davis ENC 1102 16 April 2017 A Call to Action: Legalize Recreational Marijuana Marijuana has a multitude of names, including weed, herb, pot, grass, bud, ganja, Mary Jane, and a multitude of other slang (NIDA). Whatever you call it, the debate over whether or not marijuana should be legalized in the United States is a very important discussion in our country right now. And while it feels as if everybody has an opinion about it, there are some that feel completely indifferent towards the case. Those who are content to sit and wait to see what happens need to start taking initiative and getting involved in the discussion so that they can help finally make a definite decision. Because of this, it is important to make sure that everyone gets educated about what marijuana is and how good it would be for the country if it was legal. Everyone should know what effects are, who needs marijuana, and how to make it legal in the United States. First, every stakeholder should know exactly what marijuana is, and all the ways that it can affect the body. Marijuana is a naturally growing plant that contains over 500 chemicals, including the psychoactive chemical delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, better known as THC. It can be ingested in a number of ways, including smoking, putting it in food, pill-form, and even lotions and creams. Currently, many people in our country believe that marijuana can only be used to get high and be lazy, but this could not be farther from the truth. Marijuana does have its negative side, but every drug in the world has positive and negative effects, including the legal drugs that we already allow in the United States. Some of the negative effects include blocking Shephard 2 memory formation, impaired balance, an increased risk of depression, anxiety, and very rarely hallucinations (Welsh, Spector, Astaiza). There are no drugs on this planet that have absolutely zero negative effects on the user. Most clinical drugs prescribed daily cause depression and in extreme cases, death. While marijuana can cause most of the same negative effects as these drugs, the positives that make the other drugs legal are the same for marijuana. The THC found in marijuana can prevent epileptic seizures for up to 10 hours at a time (ASPET). A study from 2010 found that people suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases could be cured with the use of chemicals in marijuana such as THC and cannabidiol (Welsh, Spector, Astaiza). It has also been found that the chemical cannabidiol can stop cancer from spreading in patients and stop the progression of disease. There are a few of the positive effects that have been found through the research of a few programs. If marijuana was legal, not only would all of these patients be able to get help, but there would be more scientists that could research all of the affects that marijuana has on the body. The next question someone who does not know much about this topic might ask is in what ways will the legalization of marijuana change the country? The widespread use of marijuana by patients with various illnesses that can be easily treated with marijuana will be the first big change. That means that people who cannot be helped by any of the current legal drugs and people that are taking dangerous cocktails of legal drugs will be able to spend less money and time on treatment and more time getting better and getting back to their lives. Police officers will also get more time to spend on more valuable situations. In 2010, police officers made one marijuana arrest every thirty-seven seconds, and most of those arrests were for small amounts of marijuana, not large quantity busts (ACLU). That time could have been spent catching all of the murderers and other more harmful criminals rather than non-violent and non-threat marijuana Shephard 3 possessors. The jails that those people will go will also be way less crowded if marijuana was made legal in our country. In a report from the American Civil Liberties Union and the Human Rights Watch, law enforcement agencies made 564,641 arrests in 2015, but 505,681 arrests for all violent crimes including rape and murder (NYTimes). That is 13.6 percent more people arrested for owning marijuana than for harming others intentionally. All of those people should not be in jail, using tax payer money to spend time with real violent criminals. On top of all this, marijuana would be able to be federally regulated so it would make the more widespread marijuana more safe. In order to legalize marijuana so that the United States can make all of these positive changes, we need to make sure that all of the stereotypes about marijuana users are debunked. Everybody, even unengaged stakeholders, think of the same image when someone thinks of a They think of a teenager or an unemployed adult that is really stupid and lazy. While these people do exist, they do not make up the majority of marijuana users. War veterans that suffer from PTSD, cancer patients that need as much help as they can get, and regular everyday people who have steady jobs and trouble relaxing are the people who need for marijuana to be legal. They are all around you, and even if you personally might not need it, they do. There are plenty of ways to take action and help fight to make marijuana legal. Anyone can email or call their state representatives and make sure that they know how important it is that we make marijuana legal. There are also many, many organizations on both the local and national levels that anyone can join. NORML, Marijuana Policy Project, Cannabis Law Reform, and Veterans for Medical Cannabis Access are just a few organization s that are doing their best to fight for the legalization of marijuana. Local newspaper and radio stations are also extremely good places to reach out to and engage all of the non-engaged stakeholders in your community. Shephard 4 We need to get every single person talking about marijuana, because the legalization of it will affect the whole nation, not just those who use or strongly dislike the use of marijuana. This is a very important topic that involves everyone, and we need to make sure that the United States is talking about it until we solve this issue. We will make marijuana legal for all of those who need it, and make sure that it is safe as possible for the entire country. Shephard 5 Bibliography Wallace, Melisa J., Robert E. Blair, Katherine W.
