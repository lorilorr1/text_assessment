Robinson 1. Shamari Robinson Karen Hanson 2/20/2017 Campaign for Rights Since the beginning of the 20 th century, equal rights has been a very controversial subject, especially in regard to rights. For a while, women did not entertain the same rights as men, and many different stakeholders have taken to voicing their concerns on the topic of gender equality. These stakeholders argue that women are still not treated equally in society and a change is needed. The National Organization for Women, (NOW) a grassroots arms of the feminist movement, have taken to advocating for rights and trying to encourage others to do the same. The National Organization for Women believes that rights are being challenged in the areas of economic pay, image discrimination, women with disabilities, reproductive rights, and family law The group feels that women need to rally and voice their opinion on matters that they believe are unequal and to that effect NOW has taken to holding protests and even demonstrations to get their opinion heard. The National Organization for Women has effectively, but perhaps fallaciously, supported its argument to encourage people and other organizations to campaign for rights by using two visual rhetoric that paints the narrative of vocal suppression. The National Organization for Women believes that neglecting rights is inhuman behavior; image A shows a demonstration being held with signs that for and Image B has a sign that says, voter This an effective Robinson 2. appeal to pathos as it is saying that the movement is creating an emotional plea to the reader. When creators use mediums to appeal to audiences emotions this is the rhetorical appeal to pathos. ( Lee Kendra. et al. 37) NOW believes that votes are being suppressed and have teamed up with the Voting Rights Alliance to get the message across and to garner support for the rights movement The women in both Image A and B can be seen wearing brightly saturated colors such as pink, which symbolize femininity. In a book titled, Purple, Gonna Die: The Power of Color in Visual the author explains that colors play a great role in influencing the feelings, emotions, and tone that people feel, and this could be and an indication as to why we associate pink with femininity (Bellantoni. 35-199). This use of color is the another appeal to pathos, the organization is trying to appeal to the emotions by the use of femininity. Image A also effectively uses pathos in the use of the term human rights. Human rights is as a term that most people are taught to associate with basic human liberties. In a book titled, Human Rights The authors offer an insight as to why the human appeals so well to audiences. The authors make a mention of the deep-rooted history that humans have been through, such as World War II, the Great Depression, and the Civil Rights Movement. These historical events draw an association with what it means to be human. It creates an innate concept that humans grow up learning. (Davis. et al. 41). NOW associates rights as human rights to appeal to that basic innate human emotion and the feeling of dehumanization, but by doing so NOW has also created the appeal by association fallacy, a derivative of the guilt by association fallacy (Almossawi 32). The Robinson 2. fallacy works by stating that a simpler subject, Is effectively a more complicated subject, Image A subtly makes the viewer feel guilty for not being involved in the movement as if by doing nothing the viewer is dehumanizing women. And this could be seen as an effective use of kairos as the reader feels that time is being wasted by their lack of involvement. Allyson Hoffman and Alysia Swachyn describe kairos an appeal to timeliness, or identifying the right time to write/say/perform the correct action to obtain a desirable A also takes a close up of a lady in the front panel, the ladies are wearing bright colors to act as a focal point that tries to grab the viewers attention, especially towards the t-shirt that rights= This is to, again, reinforce the notion of getting the viewer to get involved. Image B takes roughly the same approach that image A does in using kairos, but incorporates in a different way. Image B also has women wearing bright colors as the focal point, as they can be seen holding up colorful signs, but the image focuses more on the action of the women to which the message of the signs becomes a secondary focus. The image is trying to create a call to action, to the viewer by putting the women demonstrating emotive passion as the focal point, this can be seen with the use of three women shouting in an emotive way. This is an effective appeal to kairos as the viewer feels compelled to embody the emotions of the women in the picture, as opposed to image A where the women of focus do not look as passionate. The concentrated density of people in image B is a lot smaller when compared to image A, and this can be seen as trying to create a more intimate connection with the viewer as if to say this is normal, everyday women, campaigning, it could be the aunt or Robinson 4 mother. Which is a different use of pathos from image A. Image A tries to use pathos with the use of signs and words whereas image B tries to create pathos by using imagery to a greater extent then image A. This creates a different effect for the viewer, Image A tries to create the emotion it wants the viewer to take away, whereas image B gives the viewer more freedom of conclusion. The image acts to subtly nudge the emotion, but the viewer is ultimately left to come up with the emotional afterthought themselves, and this is another example of how Now uses competitive size to play to the strength of the image. If viewers are seeing a lot of visual information all at once they tend to miss important details that the organization is trying to get across. In an experiment by Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons viewers are told to watch two teams wearing different colored t-shirts play basketball, and count how many times a particular shirt passes the ball; in the middle of the experiment a dancing gorilla appears but it is usually missed by the audience. This can illustrate how over stimulation can cause viewers to miss important details and this is a strength The National Organization for Women played off for image B. Image B also uses ethos, the appeal to credibility, by using the American flag to gain some of its authority (Lee. 27) et al . The flag stands as a symbol of liberty and the pursuit of happiness and when faced with what activist consider an injustice the flag has often been used as a reminder of the values that the country was founded on. This association creates a sort of credible strength that the organization is trying to borrow and to bring forth to the reader. In the same way, image B borrows the credibility from the American flag, image A can be viewed as borrowing credibility from the Civil Rights Movement with the use of the iconic single clenched fist. The movement has gained notoriety as being one of the most Robinson 5. iconic movements in human history and acts as a symbol for activism, the National Organization for Women has borrowed the use of this symbol to gain credibility from it and to also gain support. The Setting for both images is another effective way NOW tries to encourage support for rights. Both images are held in what appears to be cities, and both images, although different in magnitude, have large groups rallying for rights. This stresses a larger than life perspective for the viewer, which is also an effective use of ethos. The organization is borrowing credibility from the size of the audience which draws from the old adage: is strength in It gives the viewers the perspective that the movement is larger than just a single person issue if entire cities are willing and able to get involved. The National Organization for women has used a great many rhetorical appeals to get people involved with the rights movement. Both images convey a lot of emotion and passion, in that it does convey the message well to the audience, although a little fallaciously if spotted by viewers. The images use bright saturated colors to draw the attention and to create a human emotion. The organization tries to drive its point across by using strong words like, and to really appeal towards the sense of emotion and ethics. NOW is using every facet of its resources to get people involved in the rights movement, and may eventually achieve its goal of obtaining constitutional equality. Work Cited Almowassi, Ali.
