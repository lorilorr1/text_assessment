Katherine Peterson Peterson 1 Kristen Rouisse ENC 1102 16 April 2017 Help People Die with Dignity Since the late the topic of physician assisted euthanasia began to rise because people have access to die differently nowadays compared to years ago (ERGO). Euthanasia is defined as the painless killing of a patient suffering from an incurable and painful disease or in an irreversible coma (Merriam - Webster). Euthanasia can be passive or active. Passive euthanasia refers to the retraction of life sustaining equipment and treatment and active euthanasia involves drug administration. By implementing laws on euthanasia and or assisted suicide, it will medical . . . (Compassion and Choices). These laws could potentially end suffering as a whole and let people die with dignity. Death is inevitable and when someone is suffering from a debilitating illness, they should be able to control when they want to die. Thus, because many people are suffering with debilitating illnesses, those who do not have debilitating illnesses or have families and close friends with debilitating illnesses should participate in peaceful protest that Compassion and Choices and other organization hold, help contact the government about assisted suicide and euthanasia, and inform those who are confused or unsure about what assisted suicide and euthanasia is about. By participating in one or more of these actions, hopefully legislature will legalize assisted suicide and euthanasia and people who are suffering can die peacefully and with dignity. Many people have a misconception to what assisted suicide and euthanasia due to lack of knowledge. They are unaware of the benefits that could occur if assisted suicide and euthanasia Peterson 2 becomes legal. The main benefit which is ending the suffering. There are millions of people throughout the world who are kept in hospitals or are bound to their houses who are suffering from debilitating illnesses that want to die to end their misery. Not only does the patient need assisted suicide and euthanasia to be legal, but so do their family and friends. Imagine watching your close friend or a family member suffering and you could not do anything about it. A dying physical suffering can be most unbearable to that immediate family (Lonestar). With the legalization of assisted suicide and euthanasia, family and friends who have someone suffering will be able to condone their wishes by ending their suffering. Compassion and Choices released an article in 2014 about a woman named Brittany Maynard. Brittany was enduring brain cancer which caused frequent seizures, stroke like symptoms, and severe head and neck pain (Compassion and Choices). She wanted to die peacefully and with her loved ones close by her, so she chose to shorten the dying process by taking the aid-in-dying medication she was given. This medication was sanctioned (approved) under the Oregon Death with Dignity Act. Death with Dignity Act allows terminally-ill Oregonians to end their lives through voluntary self-administration of lethal medications prescribed by a physical for that purpose. Since this medication was legal under act, Brittany was able to accomplish her wish of dying peacefully and in her loved arms. Make assisted suicide and euthanasia legal so those who are suffering can make the decision Brittany made and die peacefully with their loved ones by their side. While legalizing assisted suicide and euthanasia may not seem apparent to those who effected by suffering, it is still a mission that should be supported by everyone. Whether it is in the future or now, one can have a family member or close friend become ill with a debilitating illness and want to have a way to end their suffering. To deny a person their right to Peterson 3 die because of a debilitating illness is purely injustice. Giving a person to choose to end their suffering gives that person one final decision to truly make them happy. It gives them the ability to do what they feel is right for themselves, but what is also right for their family members and friends. It is not too late to help with this cause.

The legalization of assisted suicide and euthanasia has been a topic that has been a question of debate for ages now.
