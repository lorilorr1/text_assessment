Mohian 1 Salehin Rahman Mohian Oana cimpean Composition II Project I Intermediate Draft February 2 2017 Gun control in America The issue of Gun control in America has come up recently in the controversy in America after the recent shootings. Many laws have been imposed and changed over time but still the death rate due to gun violence still remains high in America. It started with the Brady Act in 1993 the first gun control law in America by the congress that to conduct general backgrounds check on firearm purchases. Such laws were vigorously opposed by the National Rifle Association. National Rifle Association represents the Americans cling to the Second Amendment that allows citizen the right to carry a gun for their own safety issue and banning of firearms as well as background check. Due to this disagreement the problem over gun control is still unsolved to this day. Despite all the argument between these two stakeholders they both have a common ground or a shared interest which is safety for civilians. Therefore they can both work to establish a compromise which will benefit the country in the long run which will be good for all. An estimate of 32,000 people dies every year in America (bradycampaign). Brady campaign was implemented to make a safer America by controlling the sales of guns and checking background of the Mohian 2 sales that will lead to the reduction in gun deaths and injuries. It has a clear mission which is to a safer America by cutting gun deaths in half by (bradycampaign). It will make its mission successful by creating a policy which focuses on background checks to all gun sales, which will stop the gun dealers that supply all crime guns as well as to change social norms of guns at homes, to prevent homicides and suicides that happens in daily life (brady campaign). According to statistics America had the highest homicides by guns in 2012 (BBC, 2016) compared to other neighboring countries. Brady at believes this was due to the viability of guns to civilians without proper checking and some people are able to access firearms illegally from their friends or families (bogus 2008). The national rifle association for gun rights which vigorously opposed any gun laws implied by Brady campaign. This association has a different mission which is to allow people the right to carry gun and bear arms to their right for self defense (national gun rights). Majority of America are against and disagree with a stricter background check policy and gun control laws as they believe they are taking their rights away of carrying gun. Americans view Gun ownership is most cherished right of citizenship (koesis,2015). Despite its critics, several credible polls have shown that many Americans have held positive opinions of the NRA since the early 1990s. According to a Gallup Poll from 2015, 58 percent of Americans viewed the NRA favorably (Nationalrifffleassociation). However, because many people have access to open arms, the risk of homicide, suicide and unintentional shootings increase. Both sides believes they are in the right and other is in wrong but they have the same common ground which is safety for civilians and improvement. The National Rifle Association believes that civilians should be given the right to own guns for self defense under the Second Amendments. On the other hand Brady campaign believes that to reduce the death due to mass shooting, killing, violence, Mohian 3 firearms needs to be eliminated especially in households where suicides and homicides is most common. Brady Law required a five-day waiting period and background check on people attempting to buy handguns and placed the responsibility of conducting the checks on state and local law-enforcement (Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act). Many Americans belive that keeping a loaded gun helps them feel safe and keeps them ready for any kind of crime under any circumstances. But statistics shows that people who keep gun in the house are 90% more likely to die by homicides as well as commit crimes than the people who From 1982 to 2012, its said that US had roughly 62 mass shootings. In that 49 were done using legal weapons according to a research done by Mother Jones (Follman, Aronsen, Pan, 2016). In the light of such tragedies these two stakeholders can be in the debate of gun control but still hope of compromise. They can come to a compromise since both the stakeholders want betterment and safety of their citizens. The compromise will still let people have the right to own guns just in a safer way. First of all, if both stakeholders agrees to eliminate all the gun dealers who supply to the customers illegaly it would create a difference and an efficient way to cut the death rate caused by incidents like mass shooting. If the laws of checking background of the customers was strict so many mass shooting occur in the past few decades. There was even an attempt in assassination of President Reagan. James. This suggests that people still have access to buy guns illegally. Therefore if the both stakeholders agrres and compromise, they could establish a policy. A complete check of gun sales records from each arm dealers. This will lead to identify and ban the gun dealers who are involved in illegal activity of selling guns without proper documentation. Another way to reduce death by suicides is if both the stakeholders agree that firearms are the leading cause of it. Then they can compromise and conduct classes to educate the civil on gun safety rules. They Mohian 4 can request the department of education to create new education program of gun safety to be taught in middle school. Along with the first amendment which tells the danger, impacts of guns as well as what to do when present in an environment where guns are present. This will not only educate people but will also decrease death in the long run. Both sides believes that in the right and the other is wrong, but one fact remains which is stronger laws on gun controls can prevent further massacres from occurring. There is a hope for compromise if both the stakeholders are willing to negotiate in spite of having different views on the debate gun control. Due to the common ground they share, new policies can be implied such as to conduct a complete background check of gun sales, records of gun dealers in the country. Create new education program of gun safety to create awareness among the citizens. This will hopefully reduce the number of mass shooting, suicides, homicides taking places around the country. If both the stakeholders work together on this they will be able to build the safe America they dream. Mohian 5 Sources 1.
