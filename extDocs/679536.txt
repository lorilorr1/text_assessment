Mamouch 1 Soufyane Mamouch Professor Meredith Modlin-Jackson ENC 1101 5 March 2017 Mexican Immigration Mexican immigration has been a great influence on America. There has been a lot of research discussing the difference between how the lives were before they moved, and how immigration has positively affected them after. In sources before 2010, you can see how little opportunity the immigrants had, and how poor they were because of that. They lived in poor towns, unable to have the ability to use modern technology. When looking at the sources from after 2010, the positive changes from moving to America are very clear. The movement of Mexican immigrants to the United States gave these immigrants the benefit of technology, jobs, opportunities, and a culture shift, while the immigrants gave America a boost in the economy, diversity, and hope for a bright future. Throughout the years, research have found out the positive aspects for immigration moving from their country to immigrate in the United States. Before 2010, immigrants originating country they lacked access to technology and struggled to find job. El Bosque is a small town in Mexico. known by natural resources, but an extremely poor area. The local people have enough opportunities for jobs, so they making their living off picking crops. In addition, they have any access to Mamouch 2 technology. For example, they have access to telephones and computers in both homes and schools. After 2010, the movement of immigrants to the United States to the rural areas such as Rabun country, Georgia, and Routt Country has increased. Now that they have migrated to America, they have numerous job opportunities and are able to use high-end technology. The employers are able to hire these workers at a much lower price than American workers. The workers offer flexibility for these work sectors, considering their skills sets allow them to do many things, from building walls to picking field crops. In addition, they get more access to use the technology, for example, cellphones, computers, and television at homes. Before 2010, the source talks about how Mexican immigrants are going to be affected by America. These changes include genders role. For example, an experience of recent immigrants from Mexico living in California investigates the changing impression of sexual and societal standards, including gender roles and decision-making when it comes to expanding their families. It addresses the shifts in social norms for Latin Americans as they adjust to the American culture, and the major shift of contraception use, thus altering the reproductive patterns of the immigrants. After 2010, this source discusses how America has been affected by Mexican immigration. This large immigration will lead to a bonding of races and culture making America nation rather than an area divided by race. Changes in interracial marriages, interracial children, friendships, and workplace environment could be a result of this immigration, considering that Mexicans are documented for having a higher fertility rate than other races. Mamouch 3 To summarize, the movement of Mexican immigration to the United States has common interests for both the rural area in the US and the immigrants. Mexican immigration has positively impacted America by boosting the economy, increasing diversity, and providing hope for a better future. America has positively influenced the immigrants by providing them with technology that they have, as well as many jobs and other opportunities. Immigration has positively impacted everyone, both the Mexican immigrants and Americans. With all of the positive changes, America is a more diverse country, and there is hope for a brighter future in the United States.
