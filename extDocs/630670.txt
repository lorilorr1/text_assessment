Kimberly Ledesma Mrs. Penuliar Enc1102 Project 1: Intermediate Draft 1/29/17 The Two Sides of Test Taking If gone to public schools at any point of your life, taken standardized tests. It seems that every year the number of tests administered to students goes up. Obviously the organizations that provide or overlook testing are going to support more standardized assessments. An example of these organizations is the Education Testing Service (ETS) and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The Center for Public Education (CPE) and the American Evaluation Association (AEA) are also involved in standardized testing but have different perspective. Although the Educational Testing Service (ETS) believes in the benefits of assessments for students and the American Evaluation Association (AEA) believes that the benefits of testing students do more harm than good. These two organizations have the best interest of the student at heart, and can possibly compromise by finding a positive alternative to the standardized testing we know today. The ETS is an organization that provides tests for students. You may be familiar with the ETS because of the general test taken prior to graduate school or business school. They are a nonprofit organization meaning that the money they receive from students taking their tests goes right back to their testing services. On their website they state that a lot of work goes into assuring that their tests are the best they can be by research, customizing assessments, the option of paper-and-pencil or computer testing, and much more. (K-12 Assessment Programs) These tests just provide feedback on how students are doing and learning in their classes, they also give teachers information on how they are doing their job. This potentially leads to improvement on both insight on more effective teaching and learning. Another positive point regarding the ETS is they consider testing anxiety and also fairness in testing. When improving and expanding their assessments and strategies, these topics are considered and dealt with in the appropriate manner. This will ensure positive progression of standardized tests and that the appropriate accommodations will be put into place. The AEA is an association that dedicates itself to evaluating in different facets. The association believes in the improvement of that be improving the testing itself or finding an alternative. The association wrote a report on their position regarding high stakes testing and how it has negative Some of these negative consequences include more dropouts, deprofessionalization of staff, and the concentration of money going toward testing. (American Evaluation Association 1) Also, under No Child Left Behind, every annual test has to meet achievement leading to a of sanctions and interventions. (Brown) The AEA report also discusses that one of the issues with these tests is that they are insufficient. There is more to a knowledge that an assessment cannot family environment, their economic status, and their health. These two groups disagree when it comes to the topic of testing because the Educational Testing Service believes in the advancement and growth of assessments, while the American Evaluation Association looks to find an alternative for these standardized tests. The ETS is building upon the preexisting assessments and systems in place. The AEA in their position statement on high stakes testing lists expectations for improved evaluation. Some of these expectations include, measurement specialists and advisors involved in high stakes testing programs consider not only technical and theoretical but also consequential issues, such as the welfare of students, educators, schools, and society. Also, that important decisions (for example, grade to grade promotion/retention, graduation, certification, classification, monetary rewards/sanctions) about students, teachers, and schools should not be made on the basis of any single test or test battery, no matter how many times it may be (American Evaluation Association 3) Their individual missions both have several points in common. The ETS states that their mission is advance quality and equity in education by providing fair and valid assessments, research and related services. Our products and services measure knowledge and skills, promote learning and performance, and support education and professional development for all people (https://www.ets.org/about/who/) The mission says, improve evaluation practices and methods, increase evaluation use, promote evaluation as a profession, and support the contribution of evaluation to the generation of theory and knowledge about effective human (http://www.eval.org/p/cm/ld/fid=4) They both value knowledge and the students/faculty involved in the testing. A great way for ETS and AEA to compromise on the issue of test taking is not to get rid of test taking completely, but to find a positive alternative that provides the results needed and the relief for students. In an article written by The Washington Post some points are brought up to create a compromise. They mention a continuation of testing annually third through eighth grade and once in high and also getting rid of annual testing and giving states freedom to decide. An option for states to consider is having a single assessment in the elementary, middle, and high school levels. According to the article this is known as span which is a favored approach by the National Education Association. (Brown) This is an effective compromise for the two organizations mentioned because it does not eliminate testing altogether. Testing will still be present in the education system, but not as we know it today. This alternative will give students, faculty, and the government the information they need with less cost, less testing, and overall just less stress. Although ETS and AEA both have the students in mind when it comes to assessments, ETS believes beneficial while the AEA believes they do more harm than good. Both sides of the issue have very valid and important points. The knowledge and educational growth of the students is priority. The ETS believes in building upon the already existing assessments and systems that are in place regarding test taking. The AEA believes in finding a better alternative or minimizing the amounts of testing while still producing the results needed to improve the education of students. This issue may not seem as important as others like world hunger or poverty for example, but the fact is that this is the future of our nation. Their education matters more than it is recognized, therefore should the time they spend in school be spent primarily on absorbing material or on testing them to see if mastered what they are learning? At the end of the day, are scores in school enough to evaluate a progress? Or can an alternative option be found to promote even more success in students? Works Cited Educational Testing Service.
