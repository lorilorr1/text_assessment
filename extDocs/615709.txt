Uzoegwu 1 Kelechi Uzoegwu Kevin Ip ENC 1102 January 29, 2017 Betsy DeVos and Education in America Following his recent inauguration, President Donald J. Trump was quick to nominate Elisabeth Betsy DeVos, a philanthropist, to succeed Phil Rosenfelt as the Secretary of education of the United States. However, the presidents proposition stirred a lot of controversy regarding his credentials and her ability to successful manage the American system of education. The popular opinion amongst most liberal Americans is presented under the impression that Mrs. appointment is as a result of finely crafted nepotism (Coryton 1). There is a lot of controversy and the entire conversation can be completely summarized as follows DeVos lacks the perceived necessary skills and administrative experience required for the complete and successful rehabilitation of the United States public education The concept of DeVos as secretary of education strikes terror in the hearts of the majority of liberal America much to the consternation of conservatives. It is believed that the appointment of DeVos will lead to a slow and steady deterioration of the educational system beyond acceptable standard. Despite popular opinion, extensive research and consideration of the stakes has led to the conclusion that Betsy professional history and experience can positively impact the the educational system in America. In order to advance the educational system in the United States, liberal Americans will need to modify their preconceived Uzoegwu 2 expectations of administration, be willing to collaborate cohesively with the secretary of education who will have to make notable amendments to voucher program prior to its execution. Betsy DeVos, who is primarily known for her philanthropy is the chairman of a private investment firm in Michigan known as The Windquest Group (Coryton 1). DeVos has about 35 years of political experience and has been elected four times as the chairman of the republican party (Betsydevos.com 2). In addition to her experience DeVos has held other leadership positions within many political parties and other foundations like the American Foundation for children, Artprize, the Philanthropy roundtable and the DeVos Institute for Arts Management at the University of Maryland (Betsydevos.com 2). DeVos works primarily to eradicate internal and external barriers that retards ability to thrive in different environments (Betsydevos.com 2). Despite her outstanding qualification, there is still an outstanding conversation questioning her competence and qualifications. A majority of the population, and the board of education is majorly concerned with Mrs. Betsy DeVos plan to execute voucher programs that will subsequently lead to a reduction in the amount of funds received by public schools for the pristine education of children. The voucher program is designed to allow children in poor public schools to switch to private schools while the government bears the cost of the transfer (Hutchinson 1). Opponents of Mrs. DeVos speculate that this program is part of a larger plan to defund public education and push children into education built on a popular religion platform. This is justified by the fact that about eighty percent of student in private schools attend religious schools (Hutchinson 1). In the event that this speculation is backed with evidence the implementation of this program will go against first amendment which Uzoegwu 3 emphasizes the separation of church and state in legislation. Based on these ideas, opponents of Mrs. DeVos voucher program believe that the government has a responsibility to invest in poorly performing public schools in order to increase their quality of education (Hutchinson 3). Secretary DeVos recent back lash with the Michigan board of education after her huge investment into public charter schools adds to their contention (Newyorktimes 1). Despite the conflict that exist between Secretary DeVos and liberal Americans, the salient goal that exists between both parties is to develop a constitutional plan to provide quality education and conducive learning environments to students who go through public school education in the United States. At first glance it seems almost impossible to achieve a compromise between both stakeholders because of their political disagreements and individualistic opinions on the proper and correct way to fix the problem of poor public schools in the country. Liberals push for investments in public schools and are more hopeful about the resurrection of poorly performing schools whereas Secretary DeVos presents a straightforward plan to enroll students to a privately owned school. Her approach is firmly contended because it threatens the current secularity of the public education system (Hutchinson 1). However, a closer analysis on shows that it is in fact possible to achieve a feasible compromise. A recent study conducted school showed that the implementation of the voucher program improved students academic performance as measured by the Texas standardized tests (Gray et. al, 344). It is important to reiterate that both parties will need to collaborate for successful implementation. In order to gain this cooperation DeVos will have to remove any bias that would cause students to be primarily placed in schools with religious foundations and Uzoegwu 4 respect parental consent. Poor public schools should also not be completely defunded, but continuous efforts should be made to enhance the stability and standards of the schools. This compromise seems like an easy fix, but it is the larger picture formed from a series of minute processes. The school voucher program should be implemented in a way that lead to the neglect of the development of public schools. Some people argue that the voucher program will act in favor of the wealthy and exclude benefits for special needs kids (Hutchinson 2). An easier alternative will be to remodel the school voucher in a way that it will cater for every child and provide substantial funding to public schools. Unfortunately, this plan is not feasible. The sensible compromise would be to allow the implementation of the voucher and meticulously monitor the program to prevent bias. Implementation of this program will eventually cause a secondary competition between private and public schools who will now compete, by raising academic standards, for funds from the government (Nathan 341). This will fulfill the primary goal of ensuring higher education standards for students. The government however should not use this rhetoric as an excuse to neglect the needs of public schools. The need to pursue secular education will rest solely in the hands of the parents who may decide to allow their kids to remain in public schools. Recent research conducted in the past year shows that voucher programs have intrinsic long term benefits for communities where they are implemented (Nathan 341). The controversial conversation regarding Secretary DeVos administration which is continually fueled by her previous mishaps in Michigan state will need to be diverted to a more objective point of view. Both parties will need to collaborate to ensure that the needs of students, which is the primary and common concern, is met. Secretary DeVos will implement the school Uzoegwu 5 voucher program and efforts will be made to control any biases regarding the exemption of lower class children and children with special needs. Public schools, although they might face a budget cut, will not be financial neglected as they push forth and compete with private schools for the greater amount of government funding. Secular education becomes a choice and the deciding factor that will eventually determine the ability to be placed in private schools. Uzoegwu 6 Works Cited Betsy DeVos.
