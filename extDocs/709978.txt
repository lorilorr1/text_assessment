Student 1 Student Thornton ENC 1102 16 Apr. 2017 Helping to prevent pollution one step at a time A recent issue of pollution has surfaced that needs to be addressed. CalRecycle defines pollution prevention as, all forms of pollution, including toxics and other pollutants emitted into air, water, and land. Waste prevention is a type of pollution The main type of pollution that will be discussed in this paper involves littering, also known as, waste prevention. Recycling is a form of pollution prevention that attempts to stop littering all together. CalRecycle defines recycling as, waste as material to manufacture a new product. Recycling involves altering the physical form of an object or material and making a new object from the altered Recycling involves using old materials to create new materials and by following this process, there would be no reason to litter and pollute the environment. Recycling should occur because pollution prevent has benefits for society, benefits for health, and benefits for the environment. Society is growing and changing every day. When it comes to pollution prevention, it changes just as much to help society and its growth. prevention had its origins in 1976 when the 3M Corporation initiated the 3P program and North Carolina adopted waste minimization as state-wide priority. By 1990, virtually all the fortune 1000 United States corporations had pollution (Overcash 1301) From this quote, anyone can see that pollution prevention is growing rapidly. In just fourteen years, pollution prevention went from only being available in one corporation to 1000 United States corporations. Now is the best time Student 2 to join the cause of pollution prevention than ever before due to this rapid growth. M. Overcash also states in the article that Europe and the United states had to undergo multiple stages in the past 10-20 years to help the spread of pollution prevention. (Overcash 1301) Some people may say that they cannot join the cause of pollution prevention because it has been around for so long and it is too late to join. But from statement, anyone can see that pollution prevention has not all been around, so it is not too late to join the cause. A recent stakeholder that has come forward to proudly promote recycling and its benefits is the American Paper and Forest Association. They claim that with recycling, the health is protected. member companies use of recovered fiber results in avoided greenhouse gas emissions of more than 18.5 million metric tons of (afandpa.com). These greenhouse gas emissions pollute the air and affect the health of the environment. But with recycling, they can recover fiber that avoids greenhouse gas emissions. Another claim the stakeholder makes is that with more recycling, the more pollution prevention there will be. According to Jefferson Hopewell, recycling is one of the most important actions currently available to reduce these actions (Hopewell 2115). These sources work together to promote recycling for the benefits that involve the environment. Now is the perfect time to join the cause of recycling for pollution prevention because the environment is a vital place where everyone lives. The last reason recycling should occur is because it benefits the health of everyday people. can produce both long- and short-term adverse health effects, including bronchitis, headaches, heart disease and (Weinblatt) The problem of pollution must be treated as soon as possible. The health of the people is directly affected with pollution. pollution has been linked with a broad range of health 1861) With more Student 3 health problems, the shorter the life spans will be for humans. Recycling helps to prevent pollution, which in turn, prevents these long- and short-term health effects. Everyone should do their part and help with recycling for the benefit of their own health. Non-engaged stakeholders should care about the issue of pollution prevention because they live in the same environment as everyone else. It is up to everyone who lives here to help take care of the environment the ways they should. People who do not recycle for the benefit of pollution prevention do not reap the benefits for society and their own health. Ineffective solutions to this problem that have been offered in the past to help pollution prevention have been to focus recycling on one certain material. The American Forest and Paper Association promotes paper recycling for pollution prevention (afandpa.com), while International Plastics promotes plastic recycling for pollution prevention(interplas.com). If the public focuses their efforts on only paper recycling or plastic recycling, they lose sight of the goal of recycling all materials. When the public decides to recycle all materials, the more pollution they can prevent. One reading this paper may wonder how they can get involved with recycling. Or they may wonder how they can even begin to promote pollution prevention. One action would be to start using the recycling bins that different counties have made easily accessible. If the non- engaged stakeholders do not have easy access to a recycling bin, they can start by making their own recycling bin. After making their own recycling bin, then they can take it to a recycling center until their county can implement an at home recycle bin. Recyclingcenters.org is a great source to locate a recycling center by their location. This source not only helps to locate a recycling center, it also gives updated recycling news, directions to all recycling centers, and tips on recycling. Student 4 Habits are created with daily practice and initiation to start one. In the beginning, it may seem very difficult for the non-engaged stakeholders to recycle, but it can become easy. When the non-engaged stakeholder recycles daily, they can see how little time it takes up of their day. Once they make recycling a habit, they can help the spread of recycling by promoting it and its practical ways to everyone they know. Other reasons to not recycle are because if there are no recycling bins available in public, then they should just throw away their trash. If no recycling bins are available in public places, that is even more so a reason for non-engaged stakeholders to get with recycling centers to provide these bins in public areas. This can help the spread of recycling. The more people get involved with the spread of recycling, the more pollution prevention will be spread as well. Pollution is a spreading problem that affects the society, the health of the environment, and the health of everyday people. Pollution prevention constantly changes just like society does. When society notices the affects pollution still has on the environment and the health of the public, recycling will be widespread one day. Regarding pollution prevention, recycling plays an important role. Actions to start recycling include using the recycle bins available by the county, or making your own recycle bins and then taking the materials to a recycling center. Recycling is just a matter of throwing a can in a recycling bin. This simple action can have so many benefits attached like what was stated earlier. If recycling can be so simple, why is it such a struggle for everyday people to partake in recycling? Every piece of material that is recycled, helps the society become one step closer to a higher pollution prevention rate. With a higher pollution prevention rate, society grows, the health is protected, and the health of humans are protected. WC: 1215 Student 5 Works Cited Hopewell, Jefferson, et al.
