Randy Wamsley Erika Staiger Eng. 1102 23 April 2017 Do Your Part, Be Water-$mart! The need to practice proper water use is now! As our cities and families grow, the need for clean, fresh water becomes more important than ever. Laws and regulations can be slow to pass and implement, allowing problems such as pollution and over-pumping of our aquifers to get worse before we start to fix them. By promoting awareness, educating the general public, and encouraging people to take action, the mission of the website of https://randywamsley5.wixsite.com/waterourfuture is to reduce waste water, conserve and safeguard natural sources, and save families money in order to provide this resource for our children and future. Contrary to popular belief, having a clean and productive source of water is an ongoing public issue, even in places with abundant supplies such as Florida. With simple practices and just a little knowledge, tax payers can save money and benefit the future of their families! no big secret that Florida is experiencing a population boom as northerners are flooding in to live out their days in the sunshine state; this puts strain on the regional resources available and inadvertently causes degradation of the environment. Heavy irrigation from farming, landscaping nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous, and over-pumping the aquifer for drinking water is causing harm to the hydrologic system in Florida. The need to reduce the demand and improve the quality of our water is urgent; the average family is thought to use 80-100 gallons of water per day (USGS)! This water is taken from wetlands, rivers, and aquifers in large quantities, treated to drinking standards, pumped to homes and businesses, then either sent to sewage treatment plants or returned to the environment in poor quality and in much less amounts. The Florida Everglades is a prime example of the destruction of natural hydraulic systems. Historically the Florida Everglades covered over 100,000 km 2 , now, due to agriculture and urban development only about 47,000 km 2 still exist, devastating the ecosystem along with it (Impact and Mitigation...,1-2). Despite years of restoration efforts, progress is slow and producing minimal results; scientists have noted huge declines in flora and fauna, for example, as much as 90% loss of waterfowl have been lost since the (Impact and Mitigation..., 4). This should be a reason to incite everyone to take action to preserve and protect our precious resources and ease the burden on our governments as well as our pocket books. All public water is cleaned to drinking quality, no matter its particular use. That same treated water is used to flush toilets, wash cars, and water lawns; this costs a lot of money, but there are other options. Limiting and being mindful of water use can save a households money, by reducing the water bill. Protecting natural systems means, not only safeguarding the supply of water for future generations, but aids in improving water quality as well. Wetlands act like treatment plant and filter pollutants such as suspended solids and excess nutrients (Impact and Mitigation, 4). The quantity of water taken from the system is just as important of the quality and quantity of water being put back in. Any water that is not washed down a drain is reintroduced to the surroundings as runoff. This water tends to flush out fertilizers and pollutants from our lawns and streets. Nutrients that are commonly over-used as fertilizers, such as nitrogen and phosphorous are said to be single largest cause of water quality degradation in (Sources of nutrients impacting surface waters in Florida: A review, 80). This is in reference to the excess nutrients added to the system that precede algal blooms, reduce fish populations, and kill coral. More often than not, excess fertilizers used in landscaping, to make lawns look greener, damage the ecosystem and pollute waters; this is preventable and there are existing guidelines to help. With a little knowledge and some changes in behavior, families can cut costs and contribute to the conservation of our natural resources. The website https://randywamsley5.wixsite.com/waterourfuture , is specifically created to provide abundant information and actions anyone can take to do their part. Existing and creditable agencies such as the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD), Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), and the United States Geological Society (USGS), have tips and guidelines already in place to make saving money look easy! Climate suitable vegetation and proper watering measures can cut water used on lawns. Removing and limiting the use of pesticides and fertilizers can significantly decrease pollution in run-off. Limiting showers, using water saving appliances, and simply being mindful goes a long way in conserving treated water, thus decreasing the quantity taken from the natural systems. The SWFWMD website even provides a water use calculator to estimate a current use and can be a tool to compare progress and savings. The Environmental Protection Act of 1971, and the Florida Air and Water Pollution Control Act authorize the Florida Department of Environmental Protection and other government agencies, such as SWFWMD, to control and regulate water use (Florida Bar Journal). They set the standards and issue permits to control how much water is consumed, how it is being used, and the quantity and quality of waste water returning to the system. The public policy of Florida is to the waters of the state and to protect, maintain, and improve the quality thereof for public water supplies, for the propagation of wildlife and fish and other aquatic life, and for domestic, agricultural, industrial, recreational, and other beneficial uses, and to provide that no wastes be discharged into any waters of the state without first being given treatment necessary to protect the beneficial uses of such (Florida Bar Journal, 3). Rules and regulations are already in place to provide the necessary guidelines for proper water usage (SWFWMD). If a business or household were to disregard these standards, fines could be issued to offenders. Some state and city governments provide incentives for installing reduced rate appliances such as low-flush toilets, and water-efficient washing machines and sinks; the city of Atlanta, Georgia provides a $100 rebate for each water- efficient toilet installed (USGS)! With a few clicks of the mouse, these organizations can provide information on native vegetation for your lawn that thrives in the local climate, thus eliminating the need to water the lawn excessively or using fertilizers. They can also provide tips to evaluate a water consumption. SWFWMD is making a push for the use of reclaimed water, this is water recycled or treated at sewage plants and is not permitted for direct human consumption but can be used for other purposes, such as agricultural use, watering lawns, wetland restoration, and some industrial use. This is more cost-effective by decreasing the need for further treatment, plus benefits the environment. The burden of writing and implementing laws and regulations to safeguard our water is that a very slow process; this is why the need for action is urgent! Small and simple changes in water consumption benefit the environment and save money. Natural resources are not infinite or indestructible, it is up to society and individuals to take action to conserve, preserve, and restore the natural systems to ensure their survival for future generations. easy for anyone to your part and be water Website: https://randywamsley5.wixsite.com/waterourfuture Word Count: 1217 Works cited http://www.swfwmd.state.fl.us/education/watersheds/.
