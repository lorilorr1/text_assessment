Caruso Page 1 Paige Caruso Mark J Nusspickel ENC 1101 1/29/17 Technology and Children In this day and age technology plays a huge part in everyday activities. Not only are adults being affected by the new and fascinating technology however, children are being subjected to it as well. There is an increased use of computers at elementary schools in addition to abundant learning that is being done through some form of technological media. Children are exposed to screens from the day they enter this world now, children have televisions in their rooms, handheld toys that are by theirs sides (i.e. Leapfrog), and an increased trend of children under ten receiving all access to smartphones or tablets. Within the past ten years the rate of growth of technology has changed hugely. Ten years ago, smartphones were an unrealistic idea, and today they are in every hand. Children are being exposed to so much more technologica l things now, how do parents and teachers know if what they are doing is harmful or beneficial? While the rapid progression of technology seems like such a good thing, people do not seem to be asking the most important question; Is there a detrimental social impact because of increased technology use both at home and at school in children under ten?

Academic Search Alumni Edition. Web. 24 Jan. 2017. Caruso Page 2 In the article Influence Of Young Use Of Technology On Their Learning: A the main question being asked is the technology-related practices developmentally appropriate for young contrary to the first source this study found that technology is not detrimental to cognitive learning. The study also found that interaction with their children and technology greatly effects the outcome. Children whose parents provided them with a safe learning environment succeeded exponentialy rather than children with parents who left them to their own demise. In school, it was found that children strived when using technology based math learning and online books they could read with their friends. The writers of the article, Ching-Ting Hsin, Ming-Chaun Li and Chin-Chung Tsai, are very suited and credible. Ching-Ting Hsin is in the Department of Early Childhood Education at the National Taitung University in Taiwan. Ming-Chaun Li is in the Graduate Institute of Applied Science and Technology at the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology in Taiwan. Chin-Chung Tsai is in the Graduate Institute of Digital Learning and Education at the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology in Taiwan. These researchers bring light to how technology may not be detrimental; and that it benefits a learning experience. Manches, Andrew, et al. Three Questions About The Internet Of Things And  Techtrends: Linking Research & Practice To Improve Learning 59.1 (2015): 76-83. Academic Search Premier. Web. 4 Feb. 2017. In the article Questions about The internet Of Things And Manches explores three questions, do of devices influence interpretation of, and interaction with, everyday things?, how is the data that is captured by Caruso Page 3 of devices being used?, and how cognisant are children and their careers of of The author brings up the device the as an example of a toy that monitors health making it not only a bear but a protector to the child hugging it. Again with the answering the second question asked, the bear collects health data that is sent and used by the hospital and parents. The final question the author asked is yet again answer by the children may not quite understand that when they hug the stuffed animal they are releasing data to adults because they are around technology so much. This sense of data being so easily obtained contributes to the worry of parents all around. The main author of the article Andrew Manches is a professor at the University of Edinburgh in the Moray House School of Education. His article is hand in hand with the research question being discussed in this paper, he conducted an experiment the test his three questions and came to the conclusion that children can relate and distinguish between the uses of of toys.

Web. 24 Jan. 2017. Lydia Plowman and her colleges conducted a study of three, four, and five-year in 2008 to study how they interacted with technology and how their parents felt about the usage of said technology impacted the well-being. The study included both privileged and underprivileged as well as families who had abundant of technology and families with close to none. The study they conducted found that families with little to no technology around their children did not simply technology however, they wanted to wait for their children to Caruso Page 4 be ready to use technology. Most parents with children who came in contact with much technology had little to no concern about the impact of technology on their children even though they understood the concerns. experiment directly relates to the research question; she explains in her paper that children are negatively impacted by technology in three major areas, sociocultural, well-being, and cognitive. The article was written by three prestigious people, Lydia Plowman, Joanna McPake, and Christine Stephen. Lydia is a professor of education at University of Stirling; Joanna Mcpake is a senior researcher at University of Sterling; and Christine Stephen is a research fellow at University of Stirling along with being a convener of the Critical Issues for Preschool Education.

With Technology: Is It All takes into consideration that technology is a growing trend and that we must learn how to shape it to benefit us the most. The argue against technology based toys is that they take away from fundamental learning opportunities, if a child sits in front of a television all day they then have no time to play and act out what they learned in the supposed learning program. The writers describe positive technology as such that is open ended, leaving room for creative thinking. They say the problem is that there is too much technology compared to the amount of It is like the saying is good in the same goes for technology around children. Technology, such as toys the pair learning and playing simultaneously are the most effecting technology based toys.

He not only teaches undergraduate and graduate courses in early childhood education but he reserches the use of technology with children during play and learning.
