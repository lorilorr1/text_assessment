Mirzakhalov 1 Jamshidbek Mirzakhalov Ms.Kristen Collins ENC 1102 April 16, 2017 Slapping the death Medicine has always been about finding the cure, relieving the pain, creating comfort and saving lives. However, many people do not tolerate it when there is a whole branch of medicine with so-called trained doctors whose job is to prescribe people lethal injections. As a matter of fact, there exist thousands of private and public clinics performing practices called euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, and 28 countries around the world and some states in the United States totally legalized these inhumane acts around the Although euthanasia and PAS are effective and reasonable to use in the case of patients with terminal suffering and deep irreversible pain, their legalization will gravely impact the lives of people around us who otherwise would have a chance to recover. The following paragraphs will discuss instances of horrible consequences, and dark sides of the euthanasia and PAS market, explain why these cases should be so relevant to each member of our society, and encourage everyone to take steps to make a positive change. When someone decides to end their life through euthanasia or PAS, their circumstances and reasons to die vary greatly, yet most can have a better solution than death. Contrary to the way it is portrayed in the media, these practices are not used for the terminally suffering and the ones in deep pain anymore, rather for almost anyone with the choice of death. On top of that, patients who decide to die can even choose not to inform their relatives about their decision. This Mirzakhalov 2 autonomy handed to the patient will result in the situation where doctors are going to decide if they are going to save the patient or not. An oncologist Benoit Beuselinck at a large cancer center in Belgium, the second country to legalize both euthanasia and PAS Act on says there are increasingly more cases when patients with mental illnesses request euthanasia in the cases when they do not necessarily need it, and doctors together with the review committee simply accept it for profit. He also mentions that most of these cases go unreported because of the autonomy choice given to the patients(Beuselinck). What is most worrisome is euthanasia rules also give the full autonomy to the patients with mental illnesses. Logically, this policy makes it possible for doctors to avoid responsibility for the people they are killing even though the one who requested it is mentally challenged and needs care instead of lethal injection. This side of the issue makes one think about the people who could have been given some hope and care instead of blankly injecting them with what they want without even informing the family members. The issue should definitely be emphasized, and people should be thoroughly informed on the general effect of the policy and fight against its legalization. Furthermore, huge financial incentives coming from an increased number of patients requesting euthanasia or PAS make the issue even more controversial and unethical. While most of the advertisements or doctors that advocate for euthanasia and PAS try to show the part of the business where people are relieved of pain and suffering, they fail to mention a giant financial market behind these practices. Figures released in October 2012 indicate that two thirds of trusts of National Health Service had received incentive payments for meeting  for using the Liverpool Care Pathway where about 130,000 people were euthanized that year (Steve 1), and that such payments totaled million or more (Steve 2). It is this act of putting price tag on lives that scares many people and encourages to continue the fight against these Mirzakhalov 3 practices. Professor Theo Boer who served in the Euthanasia Review Committee between 2005- 2014 says that reviewing more than 4,000 individual cases, he sees a problem in this law policy. To quote his words, problem starts when the society in the form of law politics starts to facilitate this killing of oneself. On the side of the doctor, there is no longer a liberty to really act according to his or her own (Boer). Indeed, while some patients see euthanasia or euthanasia advocates as signs of hope and relief, the other party sees the patients as a client in their blossoming business. As Professor Boer says even doctors are part of this chain-like system where to follow conscience means losing a job. If there is one thing everyone should educate themselves on within this issue, it would be this financial market mess dealing with human lives. Although every practice, every medical procedure is a type of business, human lives cannot be seen with a price tag on them. No matter how beneficial it is, killing a person is and should be an intrinsically and ethically disturbing action for everyone, and therefore should not be legalized. Engaging people in this movement for a great cause is not easy, yet extremely important. Usually when the topic is discussed in public and its severity is emphasized, most people see themselves as uninvolved and irrelevant. However, there could not more relevant person than you. It is a policy that will affect our lives and lives of our dears. Center for Mental Health Services says that one in ten adolescents in the United States have clinical depression (Pratt and Laura 2), which means you are very likely to have a family member, relative or a close friend who suffers from depression. As stated above a considerable portion of people requesting euthanasia and PAS have depression and mental problems. As much as we all fight against suicide and try to discourage our dears from this activity, we must stop the people who otherwise will advocate for suicide, who will talk about its benefits, who will lead people into what they call and painless No one wants to lose their dears especially when they could have Mirzakhalov 4 been helped and taken care of. If you do not want to regret later, engage yourself and help to stop the spread of euthanasia and PAS practices. There is no better time than now. The faster you decide to join, the more lives you can have an impact on. Many people are in need of hope and support, and our goal is reach out to them and make their world beautiful again.
