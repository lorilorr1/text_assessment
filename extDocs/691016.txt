The report by the Office of the Surgeon General covers the entire basis for medical effects, while the other sources study the social factors in the practice. In addition to research on TITLE OF YOUR PAPER 5 cancer rates and treatments for the conditions, better understanding of the motivating factors and flashpoints for potential usage and addiction, better equip governments and health organizations around the world with the ability to formulate long term strategies combat and lower mortality rates related to the practice by preventing its inception.
