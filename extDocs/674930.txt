Andrew Musgrove Ms. Elizabeth Ricketts ENC 1101 04 March 2017 Change in the Conversation of Cybersecurity in the United States Recent cyberattacks have become more dangerous and disturbing as we all saw with the election hacking which released hundreds of private Democratic National Convention emails. What you may not know is that the U.S. military computer system was hacked back in 2008 by a that scanned data and opened doors in the system for about 14 months before it was destroyed. This attack did not directly cause too much harm, but it did illustrate how vulnerable even the most secure systems can be. As technology continues grow in capability and usage, the importance of cybersecurity increases. Researchers point out that cybersecurity is just as important to technology as the military and law enforcement are to a national government. The United States has military and government people deployed all over the world, and the only way to ensure that they all have access to the correct files is to store valuable information in computer databases. Cybersecurity is crucial to keeping that information secure, and with ever-changing technology, cybersecurity has evolved right alongside it. With that said, the conversation about cybersecurity from 2000-2010 varies greatly from the conversation from 2011-2017. The conversation has changed in areas such as defense mechanisms themselves, the dangers of future cyberattacks, and governmental administration plans to combat cyberattacks. The conversation about cybersecurity defense mechanisms from 2000-2010 focuses more on prevention and mentions very little military action while from 2011-2017, the conversation shifts to mention active defense and more military action. Researchers from the period 2000- 2010 commonly refer to the cybersecurity issue as a because one of the huge aspects of this time period is the increasing capabilities of a connected network (Milone 77). In 2008, Secretary of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff, wrote that connections to the government infrastructure had to be limited to properly defend against cyber threats. He goes on to describe Homeland defensive computer, which detects cyberattacks as they occur and can shut down the access point immediately, preserving the system and important information (Chertoff 4). After the preventative defense mechanisms were put in place to protect government information, there is a distinct shift in the conversation between 2011 and 2017 that will focus more on active defense and military responsibilities. First, there is a shift where researchers now refer to the conflict as a showing that not only networks are in danger of being attacked, all of cyberspace is vulnerable. Also, military action is mentioned much more frequently as cyberattacks become more of an issue. As Robert Kaiser writes in Birth of has risen to compete with terrorism as the great danger confronting the West and the (Kaiser 19). He also talks about how organizations such as the EU and NATO have drastically changed military training and preparation methods to adapt to the increasing cybersecurity threat. Kaiser point out that countries in these organizations have made cyber defense more of a military responsibility. Also, researchers note that retaliation is a possible defense mechanism, prevention is not the focus anymore. In the Air and Space Power Journal, the USAF outlines a plan that will be proactive against cyberattacks and be prepared to retaliate should an attack occur (Bottolfson 48). Across the board, researchers mention retaliation and active defense more than prevention as the conversation changes over time. The conversation about the nature of cyber-attacks themselves has also changed over time from mostly speculation to realization that the U.S. is not prepared for the future of cyberwarfare. The conversation about the dangers of cyberattacks was still fairly new in the early so the dangers of attacks were still fairly unknown. In 2008, Michael Chertoff specifically mentions the possible dangers of countries like China and Russia, and terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda and ISIS (Chertoff 2). However, although the researchers highlighted specific groups, the cyberattack scenarios were mostly speculation. Attacks against power grids and government information were talked about as worst-case attacks, but large scale attacks had not been thought of as possibilities from 2000-2010. On the contrary, from 2011-2017, details came out about the military hacking of 2008, the Sony hacking, multiple credit card information hacks, and the Russian election hacking. As a result, the conversation among researchers shifted to treat cybersecurity threats as more dangerous than originally thought. Sources fail to mention specific terrorist groups for the most part, highlighting the mysteriousness of cyber-attacks in general. Compared to 2000-2010, there is much more concern and many more calls to action from researchers. August G. Roesener of the USAF writes, . . do not adequately address the ever-increasing threat in the cyberspace (Bottolfson 50). He also makes several mentions of instead of exhibiting that the conversation has shifted to show that both the U.S. and its enemies are engaged in cyber-conflict. The conversation shift illustrates more concern overall for the future of U.S. cybersecurity policies and actions. As the U.S. government shifts power between political parties and presidents, the conversation about U.S. government involvement in cybersecurity shifts as well. From 2000- 2010 the conversation focused heavily on the executive branch and presidential plans, but from 2011-2017 the focus is shifted to other governmental agencies and the military. Researchers point out that President Bush signed some effective cybersecurity policies during his years as president such as the USA Patriot Act and the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (Chertoff 3). There is a huge focus on the president from 2000-2010 and what he did to prevent cyberattacks of the future. As the conversation progressed however, researchers focus more on governmental agencies and the military rather than the president. The conversation shifts to talk about how other agencies such as Homeland Security and the CIA have taken up more responsibility when it comes to cybersecurity (Bottolfson 40). There is also a shift that occurs where the more recent researchers tend to focus on retrospective issues rather than the future. For example, both August G. Roesener and Robert Kaiser point out that inadequate cybersecurity policies and plans in the post-9/11 years contributed heavily to the U.S. cybersecurity issue. Researchers from 2000-2010 were mainly concerned with how current cybersecurity policies would impact the future while researchers from 2011-2017 like to point out how bad the policies from the earlier years are, then address the need to fix them. The scholarly conversation about cybersecurity has undergone a significant change from 2000 to today. As threats, technology, and governments changed, the conversation changed accordingly. It changed in areas such as defense mechanisms, future attack possibilities, and U.S. government responsibilities. The conversation about defense mechanisms changed from a focus on prevention to retaliation, and the talk about future attack possibilities shifted from speculation to a much more concerning tone of realization that the United States is not prepared for the future. Lastly, the focus shifted from the office of the president to the actions of governmental agencies and mistakes made by the government in the early Works Cited Bottolfson, Carl, Gerry Fernandez, and August G.
