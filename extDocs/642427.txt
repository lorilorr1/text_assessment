Victoria Kennedy Ashley Tisdale ENC 1101 30 January 2017 As Religiosity Grows, Morals Decline The world has been controlled by religion from the beginning of civilized humanity. Humans have evolved drastically over millions of years, but only one thing has remained constant throughout its existence; religion and its malevolent, misogynistic, homophobic, racist, and ethnic cleansing properties. Christianity is simply a cloak of ignorance to protect the minds of the unaware, to reassure the malicious believes in insecurities and judgements of those who are different. People crave something to always be there in times of need. In the religions like Islam and Christianity served as the African American crutch in the civil rights movement, belittling the full potential and accomplishments of the individual. On the other hand, Christianity was used yet again as a mask to the evil acts committed by millions, especially by the KKK. The KKK used and manipulated Christian followers to spread hate and bigotry. Christianity mainly served to justify the maltreatment of African Americans and those who the group classified as a minority. This method of control continues to be used through many malicious organizations including Christian based cults and hatful church groups who discriminate against an endless variety of minorities. Masking their hate crimes as acts and servitude to god allowed these organizations to grow rapidly, spreading across the United States and especially in the poverty engulfed white communities. In Ku Klux Klan, Conservative Politics and Religion: Taking Extremism to the Political The authors, Andrew Selepak and John Sutherland, discuss the relationship between the Ku Klux Klan and Christianity. They study the positive correlation involving white Christian conservatives and their acceptance of the values and beliefs. The growing branch of extremists are altering their messages and agendas to mimic Christian values and ultra-conservative politics ultimately justifying their organization as a pro-white, anti- immigration group who believes in conserving white culture and traditional ideology. project core values and ideology that align with more traditional, conservative, Christian beliefs, which taken as a whole, positions the Klan not as a racist hate group, but instead as pro-white organization. These efforts are blurring the line between extremist groups and rightwing politics. This in return attracted greater numbers in followers as the Klan would have previously been seen as the enemy in society but instead took on the shadow of a respectable Christian movement that was looking out for the interests of the white race. This can be inclusively be reflected to Nazi ideals and the removal of a specific population of people to produce a more pure race or society. Selepak, Andrew, and John Sutherland.

Cleaver makes the point that people cannot survive without religion.it serves as a reason to live, something to rely on and look forward to in a life that is purely existential. Without a transcendent force and symbolic structure there truly is no foreseeable hope in a universe controlled by entropy. This symbolic structure supplies the need for a purpose, a purpose that is predetermined by god who ultimately makes up for the of power or the disability of individuals or the community to handle Religion is a crutch for hopelessness, for guilt, for the powerful, and for the powerless. The power in which god possesses god, the individual. The individual and collective individuals have the power to do the acts that are mistaken for blessings and the work of an omnipotent being.

This article can strongly justify the reliance of religion in the civil rights movement. While segregation and tension crippled America African Americans turned to religion, especially Christianity. Although Christianity helped the black community in a time of need, it belittles the power of an individual. People thank god for the changes in society during the civil rights movement when all of the protests, marches, sit ins, and speeches were done by people. The power resides in the individual, not god. Choices were made and actions were performed by powerful people with the will to change their situation. The pro segregationists were just as active in their religion as the black community, believing god had made blacks and whites unequal and segregated as seen in the bible on different multiple occasions. In Free, Hateful, and Harmful Ronald Turner discusses the use of free speech to justify the open prejudice and discrimination against people of color, homosexuality, and how it is questionable under law due to its incitement to violence. Turner makes the point that understandings of the First Amendment presuppose that legal toleration of speech- related harm is the currency with which we as a society pay for First Amendment Referring to those who have the intent to cause harm to others and raises the question: is the currency of harm in concept and reality, and should we not be concerned that in certain contexts some members of an and society will pay a high, indeed too high, a price for the free-speech interests of Christian hate groups actively having to defend their rights of free speech and cautiously stay inside the boundaries of fine print to continue protesting show the conscious lack of logical morality in the slightest. The first amendment rights of those who preach and spread hate speech can lead to avoidable violence, racism, and prejudice by adding a more defined moral code or guide line, ultimately eliminating the spreading of groups like the KKK, Westboro Baptist church, Neo-Nazis, etc. (all Christian based organizations) The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent  - Richard Dawkins, The God Delusion.
