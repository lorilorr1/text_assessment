Student 1 Student Dr. Thornton ENC 1102 26 March 2017 Creating a Safer, Cleaner, More Affordable Energy In this day and age, everything produced is supposed to be better than the last, cheaper for consumers, and friendlier to the environment. However, when it comes to something as common as electricity, many people do not even think twice about it. While most people are aware of the other options in providing energy, they are either completely against it, or against change. Yet, everyone wants a cleaner environment, and a better bargain. The typical form of electricity, known by most people, is the grid system. A very active stakeholder on this form of electricity is the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), who not only enforce this grid system, but also strive to make it better Conversely, Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), is a stakeholder who focuses mainly on the broadening of solar energy and the use of solar panels Though there are many different ways to create electricity, solar energy and the grid system; are two types that are seemingly always at war. Because the solar-energy and grid- system forms of electricity are contentious, the compromise of creating a grid-tied solar panel can be implemented through research and funding thereby underscoring the common mission statements of these stakeholders, which is creating safer, cleaner, and more affordable energy. On one side of this topic, the SEIA is the main contributor of solar energy in the United States They are currently working with one thousand member companies to help promote clean, affordable solar energy throughout the states, as well as trying to expand the Student 2 market and strengthen the industry Some of the main goals for SEIA is producing a cleaner, more affordable way to produce energy. According to Chris Leaman, energy is one of fastest growing (Leaman). SEIA states on their website that energy is the cleanest and most abundant renewable energy source available, and the U.S. has some of the richest solar resources in the This statement is also backed up in Eric article which states, panels are the most prevalent alternative source of electrical power, with various types of these panels being used for residential and commercial applications around the (Storey). That means that anyone could start using solar energy in their daily life. Many want to help make a change and better our economy and environment; however, no one wants to put in the time, effort, or money to make that change. What most people are not aware of is that the benefits of implementing solar energy go far beyond the amount of electricity produced. The number of jobs created from the solar energy is outstanding and escalating. solar industry currently employs more Americans than Apple, Google, Facebook, and Twitter (Leaman). The total comes out to about thirty-one thousand jobs in the United States alone (Leaman). In addition to the number of jobs created from solar energy, there are many environmental and financial benefits, as well. Consumers can save thousands of dollars annually on electric bills (Storey), as well as to sell back any unused energy by installing solar panels to electricity companies for credit or profit (Leaman). Environmentally there are few downfalls to implementing solar energy in everyday life. According to Leaman, than .0005% of the Earth needs to be covered with solar energy systems to power the entire (Leaman). Which is roughly ten square miles. Concurrently, using solar energy can lead to a cleaner Student 3 environment and a healthier economy (Childress), which is exactly what stakeholders such as SEIA are working toward. On the other side of this issue, EEI focuses on the expanding the grid system, the most common type of electricity in use today. EEI has dozens of electric companies and hundreds of industry suppliers internationally They also provide electricity for over two- hundred-twenty million Americans and employ more than one million people Their mission is to provide a reliable, affordable, and clean to Americans Within the past couple of decades, there is the introduction of a different type of grid system, called the Smart Grid (Slayton). According to Lawrence Makovich in his article on the Smart Grid system, implementation of a smart grid system will enable the widespread use of renewable energy sources, allow more-distributed electricity generation, and help reduce carbon (Makovich). Slayton also talks about the Smart Grid system, and she makes a very good point, to which anyone living in this generation can relate. electrical grid powers smartphones, smart homes, and smart cars. Yet the grid itself is not so smart. Most electrical grids cannot manage the intermittency of renewable energy sources like solar and wind, so they must rely heavily on fossil (Slayton). The new Smart Grid design is intended to increase economic efficiency (Slayton). Many people throughout the world, especially in America, has become very dependent on electricity. Allan Mazur discusses the three main electrical grids in the United States: the Eastern Interconnection, the Western Interconnection, and a smaller one located in Texas (Mazur). These grids supply power to the continental United States, as well as some parts of Canada. Due to this, if there were to be some type of power outage, it could and would cause a widespread blackout Student 4 (Mazur). This makes this system very dangerous and unpredictable. By starting to use the new Smart Grid system, the way electricity is used every day can become safer and cleaner to use. Both SEIA and EEI have very similar, if not identical missions: each wants to provide a better, safer, cleaner, more affordable type of energy. Solar energy and the typical grid system are great ways to provide electricity, but both have their faults. in the 21st century, electricity is not a convenience, it is a (Childress). Both stakeholders agree Vincent claim, but the way in which the world decides to go about it is what matters. Childress also states that recently passed the United States as the leading emitter of greenhouse (Childress). It is apparent that something needs to change. These two and many more like could compromise their differences and collaborate to promote not only a cheaper form of energy, but one that does not hurt the world in which we live. Most solutions are simple, but require some work. Both stakeholders could take money received through funding and installations, and use it toward research in finding what will work best for their preferred forms of energy emission. In addition, they could manufacture and sell a grid-tied solar-panel. With this hybrid, they could produce energy that is not only safer for consumers to use, but cleaner for the environment. Different types of this hybrid could be constructed so it could be used in not only residential areas but for commercial use as well. The only downfall of this could be the price. However, the amount of money that would be saved annually would make up the difference in the price it costs to buy this system. Even though SEIA and EEI have different views on how people should get their electricity, they share the same goals on what their systems should do. If these stakeholders would come together, they not only could make ground-breaking research on how to improve Student 5 upon forming electricity but also create a hybrid system that will provide safe, clean, affordable energy. Other forms of energy could also come together too, such as wind and solar, or hydro and wind. The possibilities are unlimited; someone just needs to take the first step toward making it happen.
