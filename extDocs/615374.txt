Slater, 1 Connor Slater 1/29/17 ENC 1102 Finding Common Ground Cheerleading as a Sport For many years, boys and girls have been participating in an activity called cheerleading. Cheerleading is a combination of chants, dances, and acrobatics composed to lead a crowd at a sports event. In the present day, there are two main organizations that run the cheerleading world. One organization is the National Cheerleaders Association (NCA), which is older than the other organization, the Universal Cheerleading Association (UCA). Between the two organizations there are some discrepancies that make the two different, but when put together could help both organizations achieve a common goal. For many decades, cheerleaders have been trying to get cheerleading to be recognized as a sport, but all their efforts have failed. If the NCA and the UCA could overcome their differences in their teaching and cheering styles, they could come together and make cheerleading become a sport. The most original cheerleading (About NCA) was founded in 1948 by Lawrence Herkimer as the National Cheerleaders Association. He was given the nickname Herkie after a cheerleading jump was named after him, and he was named the grandfather of cheerleading (About NCA). Herkie was a former coed cheerleader at SMU before he founded this organization. The year after it was founded, NCA held its first summer camp, only having 52 girls attend, the next year 350 girls attended. This was the start if a very successful cheerleading company. main goal with the NCA was instill in young people the values and habits that will enable them to compete, endure, and become successful in life: preparation, dedication, tenacity, perseverance, self-sacrifice, teamwork, and leadership to Slater, 2 name but a (About NCA). Still to this day all the NCA staff wishes the same for the cheerleaders. This shows that not only did Herkie want the cheerleaders to be good at what they do, but also god citizens all around. Herkie also wrote a creed of 9 different statements that he wished would be fulfilled by every NCA cheerleader. He stated that cheerleaders should come together as a family, that team victories are much better than individual victories, classroom excellence is most important, before cheer, along with other life lessons (About NCA). This was the basis for his company and little did Herkie know how successful the NCA would become. The NCA now hosts many summer camps and competitions year-round. Throughout its 69 years of existence, the NCA has shaped its own time of cheerleading. The main goal of NCA cheerleading is to put on a show. A routine is created with many different elements. The cheerleaders are to do stunts, tumbling, a cheer, dance, and jumps. All elements are judged differently throughout the routine by a panel of judges. NCA cheerleading is very popular throughout the nation, but another type of cheerleading exists and is very prominent in the nation as well. The other cheerleading organization was created in 1974 by Jeff Webb called the Universal Cheerleaders Association. Jeff started this company on college campuses around the country with educational training through summer camps and clinics (About UCA). He wanted to teach kids from NCA about cheerleading and their main jobs as cheerleaders. Jeff always said that his main focus was to instill leadership skills in the cheerleaders at his camps. This was a different idea for the cheerleaders, because they were always taught different skills through NCA cheerleading prior to the birth of the UCA. The UCA teaches kids that cheerleaders are supposed to athletic programs and lead the crowd before and during (About UCA). Jeff also said that he wanted to teach cheerleaders what school spirit is and how to spread that spirit Slater, 3 around their school. The UCA does the same as the NCA by hosting summer camps and competitions. Although, there are some differences when it comes to competition. The routine preformed at a UCA competition does not incorporate a dance or jump section in their routine but they have a more strict judging policy on the cheer portion of the routine. The main reasoning for that is because UCA is about leading a crowd and showing school spirit, while NCA cheerleading is about putting on a performance. Although there are many differences between UCA and NCA cheerleading, there is one common goal of both associations. Cheerleading has not been the most popular activity for all of its existence, it has been argued whether cheerleading is an actual sport or not. Both associations have been pushing for many years to legally make cheerleading a sport. Many cheerleaders do not like getting criticized for just participating in an activity or hobby and not being treated as real athletes (Green). Cheerleaders spend countless hours a week in their gyms, training and getting better, and when they are told all they participate in is a hobby, it is very disrespectful. This is especially hard for coed squads with boys because of the harassment involved. The idea that males are taking part in performance (Grindstaff and West) caused a controversy in making cheerleading a sport. Most male cheerleaders try to shy away from the feminine aspects of cheerleading, which plays into gender elasticity and its limits, causing athletic organizations to question the ability to consider cheerleading a sport (Grindstaff and West). Another controversy then comes about when asking the question, is a People argue that there is no real objective to cheerleading and that is why it should not be considered a sport. Then that could be brought against other activities that qualify as sports such as diving (Green). For cheerleading to legally become a sport, the best option would be to merge NCA and UCA beliefs together to create one large group, to show that cheerleading is a sport. Slater, 4 This would be very difficult thought because of the differences between the two organizations. For this to work, both values of UCA and NCA are to be instilled by the large organization. The cheerleaders will learn how to be successful people inside and outside the gym, like they are taught as NCA cheerleaders, but they must also learn their duties as cheerleaders and learn skills of leadership and be full of school spirit, as UCA cheerleaders learn. Moreover, camps and competitions must be run, so merging cheerleading styles must happen as well. All parts of both routines will be kept, but there will still be more emphasis on the cheer portion. UCA cheerleaders will need to learn dances and jump sequences, and NCA cheerleaders will need to become more focused on the elements within their cheer and focus on their ability to lead the crowd. UCA cheerleaders will need to learn how to put on a show in all aspects of their routine, other than the cheer where the crowd leading focus will come from. Despite the differences between the NCA and the UCA, when it comes to their teaching and cheering styles, the two organizations need to come together, and rise over their differences, in an effort to recognize cheerleading as a sport. The differences between the two organizations are not large at all and could be combined to create a larger, overarching, organization. The ideas of teaching life lessons to NCA cheerleaders and the ideas of crowd leading and school spirit of UCA cheerleaders could be combined and taught together. When it comes to performing, the UCA cheerleaders could add more elements to their routine while the NCA cheerleaders focus on their cheer more and worry less about the other aspects. If the two organizations could come to terms with their common ground, they would be able to reach a goal they both have wanted for many decades, to make cheerleading officially a sport.
