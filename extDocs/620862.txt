Casey Morocho ENC 1102 Hannah Lay 23 January 2017 SeaWorld Entertainment and PETA Joining Forces for The Greater Good Since the domestication of animals, there has been an ongoing issue of animal cruelty. Thus, societies and organizations, such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals or PETA, have been formed as early as the to act as an assertive voice for the animals. However, it until the past few decades that animal cruelty became a central topic of discussion in society due to claims of neglect that animals endure at parks such as Busch Gardens and SeaWorld Orlando. SeaWorld Entertainment, which is the corporation that owns Busch Gardens and SeaWorld Orlando, want to provide educational, personal, and interactive experiences that allows guests to connect with the natural world (SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment). Millions of people believe that animals at such places should be given legal rights and shown compassion by others, which is the basis for goal. PETA believes that have rights and deserve to have their best interests taken into consideration, regardless of whether they are useful to (About PETA). In the past couple of years, PETA and SeaWorld Entertainment have bumped heads when it came to claims of animal abuse being made at their parks. Yet with a common goal of generating compassion towards all types of animals and expanding human knowledge on these amazing creatures, SeaWorld Entertainment and PETA can find a solution that support each views. The first stakeholder, SeaWorld Entertainment, is a well-known corporation that has been established over 50 years ago in 1959. Its first park, Busch Gardens in Tampa, started out as a bird sanctuary and garden (SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment). Now with over 7 different entertainment parks under its name, it is the theme park and entertainment in the U.S. (SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment). SeaWorld also prides itself in being one of the foremost zoological organizations. They house over 800 species of animals that include orcas, sea turtles, sting rays, and beluga whales. Considering just SeaWorld Orlando alone, over 20 million guests come to see the sea creatures which generates millions in revenue for the company (The Dodo). Providing more than entertainment, SeaWorld Entertainment has also helped animals who are in crisis around the world. In 2010, a rescue team was sent to the Gulf of Mexico on behalf of the stakeholder to help bring back sea turtles who were affected by the BP oil spill (SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment). Help from organizations whose focus are wildlife conservation like SeaWorld Entertainment can provide necessary medical care and resources to animals. With more than 5 million supporters and members, PETA is the largest organization that fights for animal rights (PETA). Founded in 1980, founders promoted living a vegan diet and publicly protesting animal cruelty (About PETA). However, throughout time, PETA expanded its focus to the food industry, clothing trade, laboratories, and entertainment industry (About PETA). Their attention on these areas allows animals to have a fighting chance to be spared from the suffering that results from it. One of the main accomplishments achieved by PETA include the basic welfare improvements for farmed animals in fast food chains like Burger King and (About PETA). To add to their list of achievements, PETA wants to help all the animals under SeaWorld care seek a better life than the one that is provided to them by the company. Both stakeholders have goals that are similar in specific aspects. PETA believes that are not ours to eat, wear, experiment on, use for entertainment or abuse in any other (About PETA). In addition, SeaWorld goal is to provide our guests to celebrate, connect with, and care for the natural world we with the animals. Since both main goal is to care and provide for wildlife in any way possible, SeaWorld Entertainment and PETA should do what they can to support these animals. An achievable compromise between the two stakeholders would be to send all the animals under SeaWorld custody to animal sanctuaries. Animal sanctuaries are facilities that take care of animals in habitats that are more natural. At these animal sanctuaries, the creatures would be able to roam past the enclosed space that they grew up in at the entertainment parks (Update). It would be the best idea for the animals since if they were to be sent back to their natural habitats, they would not survive. This could supply the animals with a lot of health benefits, whether its physical or mental. By doing so, SeaWorld Entertainment would also be able to address other concerns of animal abuse being made at their parks and it could create a lot of good publicity for the company. SeaWorld Entertainment could continue to provide their world class standard-of-care for the animals at the sanctuaries (SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment). The solution of transporting SeaWorld animals to animal sanctuaries has research that supports its validity. It is scientifically supported that animals held in captivity have shown stress levels and behavioral (Briefer & McElligott). This is caused by the poor welfare conditions that they live in, which includes deprivation of space, resources, physical contact, or activities experienced under natural conditions (Briefer & McElligott). In a study done by Elodie Briefer and Alan McElligott, goats who were living in poor welfare conditions were transported to a goat sanctuary to see if there was a difference in mood and health in the goats. The results from this study support the fact that animal sanctuaries allow animals to positive (Briefer & McElligott). This research also supports the stance in the solution that transporting the animals to a sanctuary is one way to achieve both goal of helping the animals. By moving them to a more natural habitat than the habitats they are placed in at SeaWorld parks, the animals will have an overall improved health. PETA and SeaWorld may be at odds but they share a common goal of wanting to help and connect with animals. This goal can be achieved by both sides if the animals at the parks owned by SeaWorld Entertainment were transferred to animal sanctuaries. This solution will benefit both stakeholders by giving good publicity to SeaWorld Entertainment and becoming a major accomplishment for PETA. Plus, the animals will live happier and healthier in a more natural setting. Hopefully in the future, SeaWorld Entertainment and PETA can join forces to make this possible solution a reality.
