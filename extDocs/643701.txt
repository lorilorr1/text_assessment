Addington 1 Madison Addington Dr. Oana Cimpean ENC 1102 27 January 2017 Do zoos affect animals negatively or positively? Zoos are an issue to a lot of animal rights activists because they believe that wild animals belong in their natural habitat and should not be caged for our entertainment Zoos ). The Association of Zoos & Aquariums (AZA) and its members envision a world where, as a result of the work of accredited zoos and aquariums, all people respect, value, and conserve wildlife and wild places Strategic ). Captive Animal Protection Society (CAPS) think that zoos do not save species from extinction. Instead, they divert much-needed attention away from important conservation work in the wild Zoos ). These two organizations have very contrasting views on zoos. AZA wants to make their zoos better and safer for animals while CAPS wants to get rid of all zoos. To resolve the conflict between the two organizations, they can come to a compromise by making the existing zoos more comfortable for the animals to live in by eliminating all cages, finding better ways to keep and look after these animals and only importing the animals that need special attention and cannot fend for themselves in the wild. Addington 2 The first stakeholder, The Association of Zoos & Aquariums is for zoos. AZA was founded in October 1924. They have thousands of veterinarians, scientists, and animal care professionals with the expertise to help endangered species. According to the AZA website 30+ species, the American bison and California condor, have been brought back from the brink of extinction because of the work of accredited zoos & aquariums and our AZA SAFE: Saving Animals from ). They have more than 600 Species Survival Plans already in place and have already spent a combined $160 million a year on conservation of animals in the wild. 180 million Americans visit AZA-accredited institutions each year. This is important because public support for conservation efforts is vital to their success. AZA SAFE: Saving Animals from ). The next stakeholder is Captive Animal Protection Society. A retired schoolteacher named Irene Heaton founded CAPS in 1957. The suffering that animals were subjected to as part of the entertainment industry disgusted her. So, she decided to start this organization in order to bring about a change to both practices and attitudes Our history ). Her organization believes that wild animals in zoos suffer physically and mentally as their complex social, behavioral and physical needs cannot be met in unnatural manmade environments Zoos ). CAPS is based in the United Kingdom and is leading the campaign to end the use of animals in entertainment, particularly in circuses, zoos and the exotic pet trade. They plan on doing this by carrying out investigations to expose and address animal suffering, educating and raising awareness to inspire new generations of animal advocates and by lobbying decision- makers to effect long-term legislative change for animals. They also made it their mission Addington 3 to provide support, advice and resources to other animal protection groups and individual campaigners. In 2004 CAPS commissioned the largest and most in-depth investigation ever made into the public aquarium industry. Their investigation revealed most animals to had been taken from the wild and disputing conservation claims by the industry Findings may sink ). In 2012 CAPS established the AnimalPledge.org scheme, which seeks to encourage the media industry to refrain from the use of performing wild animals in productions. The project was established in partnership with the Ape Alliance. In 2013 CAPS launched a new campaign entitled the Fight for . The campaign seeks to outlaw the practice of pinioning of birds in zoos. The research found that members of the zoo industry were carrying out the practice illegally (Jeory). These two stakeholders have not yet come to a resolution because one wants to eliminate all zoos and the other wants to improve them. CAPS thinks AZA will not accomplish their mission because presenting animals to zoo visitors as living exhibits teaches children that animals can be manipulated in order to fulfill their own curiosity about different animals. It suggests that animals have no right to be treated as individuals who think and feel for themselves. AZA believe that working in the natural habitat could carry out effective conservation. This will then protect individuals and entire ecosystems. Zoos ) Even though both organizations have very opposing views they have a few similarities. AZA has a program called Saving Animals From Extinction (SAFE) that focuses the collective expertise within their accredited zoos and aquariums and leverages their massive audiences to save species. This is similar to CAPS because they are also Addington 4 trying to save animals from extinction. At the same time, SAFE is expanding to increase direct conservation spending, as well as their impact on saving species through work in the field, in their zoos and aquariums, and through public engagement. CAPS also thinks it is effective to work in the natural habitats. An article on the AZA website which demonstrates that the 2 stakeholders have similar goals, states, species exist only because of the efforts of aquariums and zoos and our AZA SAFE: Saving Animals from ). CAPS and AZA are both trying to save wildlife and wild animals they just have different methods. The two opposing sides can come to a compromise by making the existing zoos more comfortable for the animals to live in by eliminating all cages, finding better ways to keep and look after these animals and only importing the animals that need special attention and cannot fend for themselves in the wild. Past solutions were to build safaris to eliminate all cages. This did not work because CAPS found that zookeepers and employees still treated animals poorly. For example, a safari park tried to force chimpanzees to mate even though scientists warned them that it would be a bad idea. Safari Park to from ) This compromise is workable because it would not only eliminate all cages, no animals would be mistreated or forced to entertain people. It is convenient because zoos could still make money even though it may be more expensive to have certified people working there. They might not get as many visitors because they will not have as many animals being imported into these zoos. This is an ideal compromise because they would have more support from CAPS and they have to worry about them trying to close down their zoos. Addington 5 The Association of Zoos & Aquariums (AZA) provides its members with the services, best practices and program coordination to be leaders in animal welfare, public engagement, and the conservation of species. The Captive Protection Society (CAPS) aims to stop the exploitation of animals in entertainment, particularly in circuses, zoos and the exotic pet trade through a combination of undercover investigations, research, campaigns, political lobbying and education. CAPS and AZA are both trying to save wildlife and wild animals in different ways. To bridge the gap between the varying views, the two opposing sides can come to a compromise by making the existing zoos more comfortable for the animals to live in by eliminating all cages, finding better ways to keep and look after these animals and only importing the animals that need special attention and cannot defend for themselves in the wild.
