Conner Cavin Anastasia J. Khawaja, MS ENC 1101 February 11, 2017 How has gender equality changed throughout time, and has it gotten better or worse? Gender equality. Two small, yet very powerful words. The argument of whether there is any sort of equality within genders has gone on for centuries. Some people believe that different genders deserve to be all equal. While others believe that all genders deserve the same treatment, respect, and view. Throughout time the equality between genders has changed very drastically from where it used to be. It has gotten better at certain levels, but has gotten drastically worse at others. Many scholars have argued this topic for years. Have times changed or have they just become so normal that people even notice when it is right in front of them. Along with the idea of gender equality, you could also pull in the idea of sexism, those terms pretty much go hand in hand. Although times have changed and the view has gotten slightly better, most sources will all agree that the equality levels between men and women are at drastically different.

Why Workplace Equality Initiatives Helping  Harvard Business Review. N.p., 5 Feb. 2010. Web. 11 Feb. 2017.). This obviously is a very true statement, but it is also something that a lot of writers just flat out say. This article focuses a lot on how people just used to women being in higher power, and how people then probably never get the chance to see that because they never allow women to higher up positions due to that fact. They raise their power because they used to it and think they are strong , but then in turn have no way to actually get used to it because they are then never in charge/lead positions.
