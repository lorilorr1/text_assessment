Maximiliano Lopez Instructor Townsend ENC 1102 16 April 2017 Project 3 Intermediate Draft Imagine a world where the beaches are full of water that is too hot to be comfortable in while swimming. A world where peninsulas like the State of Florida no longer exist because of rising sea levels. One of the key factors that may lead to this horrible future is the destruction of the Arctic region, home of many of the icebergs that are ready to melt. Many oil companies look to buy up many parts of the Arctic region to explore for oil due to a belief that there may be a source of oil in this region. Many organizations that are pro-environment, like Oceana, have already done many things to prevent this from happening. However, new leaders in the world have already planned to go along with the plans of these oil companies, and now is the time to take part in the fight against offshore oil drilling in the Arctic region. We, as citizens of the planet, and especially, residents of Florida, should be on our heels to protect the Arctic at all costs, because of most importance, it is the key to the preservation of our home called Florida. In recent years, a lot of controversy has been sparked from the topic of oil drilling around the world. From fluctuating oil prices, oil spills, and construction of big mainland oil pipelines, oil has always been the biggest non-renewable resource to draw the highest controversy. It made big headlines when one of the big oil companies called British Petroleum, more commonly known as just BP, spilled millions of gallons of crude oil in one of the biggest bodies of water in the world, the Gulf of Mexico. It was on April 20, 2010 when the Deepwater Horizon Oil Rig sunk from a big explosion on it (Frost). This led to a big pipeline underwater to burst underwater Lopez 2 and cameras revealed that the BP pipe was leaking oil and gas on the ocean floor about 42 miles off the coast of Louisiana (Frost). By the time the well was capped on July 15 th , 2010 (87 days later), an estimated 3.19 million barrels of oil had already leaked into the Gulf of Mexico (Frost). This oil spill was then officially proclaimed the worst oil spill in United States history. Another event that happened recently and is relatable to the Arctic region and to the country we live in is an oil spill that occurred on April 13 th , 2017 oil well on North Slope near Prudhoe Bay (Molinski). This oil spill was directly in the Arctic region, and Alaska has always had problems from oil spills, specifically from British Petroleum (BP) (Molinski). In this oil spill, even though there is little oil spilling from, there is more natural gas that is leaking from it. This could lead to a bigger explosion which will lead to more oil being spilled in the region. Even though there have been efforts to stop oil from being explored for in the Arctic region, big oil companies, like British Petroleum (BP), have still been able to do so. It is time that the citizens of the Earth should come to realize that oil is not the way to go, and this is exactly what the planet-friendly organization Oceana aims to do. In pushing forward anti-oil legislation, Oceana aims to make it difficult for oil companies to explore for oil in the region. All people on this Earth should pay attention to the controversial topic of offshore oil drilling because it will ultimately decide the survival of our planet. The usage of oil has always been commonly associated with global warming, the leading factor in rising sea levels and temperature of the oceans. Most importantly, for those who live in Florida, you obviously know that we live in a peninsula, a body of land that is surrounded by water on three sides. So, if the sea levels in the oceans continue to rise, then the water will ultimately force the land of Florida to succumb to being underwater. Not only that, but the temperature in the waters of the oceans will rise to a point where it is not comfortable to be in and even could be harmful. When this Lopez 3 happens, everyone can say goodbye to everything that they have come to know about Florida, and soon enough, most of the islands and lands surrounded by water will suffered the same fate. Even though a reality of rising sea levels and temperatures in the ocean is a real thing, most people in power around the world still decide to support the drilling for oil in the Arctic region, like the new President of the United States, Donald Trump. In a social media campaign by Oceana, the anti-offshore oil drilling organization, they have put forth a petition to let the United States Congress know of what they think of President Donald Offshore Drilling Agenda (Oceana). This social media campaign on Facebook allows many of the millions of people who use this social media website to become aware of what President Donald Trump plans to do with the Arctic region. If President Donald Trump is successful with what he plans to do with the Arctic region, then who knows what may be his next target. The success of this agenda would mean for the doom of many of the ecosystems around the world for wherever Donald Trump would most likely pursue to allow for drilling for oil. We as citizens of a piece of land that is almost surrounded by water on all sides must act to prevent any harm to be done to the land we live on and the ocean that surrounds us. There are plenty of organizations that push for anti-oil drilling legislation and actions like Oceana, Greenpeace, Earth Justice, and Center for Biological Diversity. Oceana, like those other organizations, argue that the burning of fossil fuels is the leading source of carbon pollution, which contributes to global warming and ocean acidification (Kkostadinov). All you must do is sign up for petitions supported by these organizations and share the knowledge that they give to you on this topic. If we do not take any action at all, people like President Donald Trump will push forward plans to contaminate the ecosystems of the world by drilling for oil in the oceans. Every person must act to stop the destruction of the planet we call home. Lopez 4 Works Cited Frost, Emily.
