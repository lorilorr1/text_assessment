ENC 1102: Project 1 Intermediate Draft Guiding Questions In preparing for the Intermediate Draft, please answer the following questions: 1. From you Early Draft, choose two of the stakeholders who are with one another. (If none of your stakeholders thus far are with one another, consider choosing two different stakeholders). What might need to happen for both of your chosen stakeholders to achieve their purpose(s) with regards to your issue or topic? The two stakeholders I have chosen are the NFL and he NFLPA (National Football League Players Union). Both stakeholders always disagree when it comes to the players being fined or suspended. The NFLPA protects the players from being punished 2. Propose at least two compromises that might satisfy each of these stakeholders regarding your chosen issue or topic. What must these two sides each give up as they try and reach an agreement? The league could cut back on some of the rules and penalties they have been coming up with lately. The NFL could stop fining the players as much. The NFLPA could stop defending as many players. 3. Choose one of the compromises you proposed in #6. What needs to be in place for your compromise to be accomplished? Explain those factors. This is an important step because you will need to prove to your audience (and your stakeholders) that your compromise is viable using research, so really think about how you could support the viability of your proposed compromise. I think cutting back on the rules and regulations on and off the field would help solve the problem of so many players being fined for ridiculous things that they should not be getting fined for. For instance, not talking to the press or a controversial hit that is a part of playing the game.
