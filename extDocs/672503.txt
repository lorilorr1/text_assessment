Stakeholders incorporate different elements like color, text, or aesthetics to intrigue their audience. Through visual rhetoric, rhetorical appeals become a constantly used tool in the persuasion attempt.

The first image presented by Smirnoff is a bottle of vodka proclaiming the idea that people can be whoever they want when drinking the product. Each level of the bottle lists a different famous person or character you can feel like from the drink.

The original goal of Smirnoff is to convince customers to buy their drink through the use of persuasive images. Alcohol is obviously a high commodity all over the world, but most of the companies all preach the same thing. Smirnoff takes a different route by making more detailed advertisements to get their point across. Whether customers buy the product is based on how the images make them feel and how good they make the product look. Smirnoff presents basic ideas in a fancy or artistic way, simply by listing names of celebrities or by depicting a baby as impure.
