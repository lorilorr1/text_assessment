Vanessa Sell Professor Bennington ENC 1102 12 March 2017 The Department of Education believes that technology is a key factor in the growth and development of a education. The main goal of The Department of Education is to further the usage of technology and making technology accessible to children of all ages, and they do this through their office, The Office of Educational Technology. The government has implemented many different programs to make these ideals a reality. President George W. Bush furthered this advancement by passing the No Child Left Behind Law, which mainly focused on elementary and secondary schooling and the technology brought into it. Through the upcoming of this program many students were introduced to technology and many educations were furthered by the possibilities of new learning techniques. These images show the goals of this department through many different appeals. However, when the two images are juxtaposed, the idea that technology should grow with children is furthered, also the ideal that technology is necessary for students to fully reach their potential.
