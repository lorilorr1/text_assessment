Mitchell Professor Gill ENC 1102 1/29/2017 Climate Change Imagine, a place where resources are scarce and the environment we live in is uninhabitable due to pollution and other factors. The world is at a crucial point in time where we must act fast. If not we will face the repercussions of a world where our actions have damaged the most beloved thing around it. Earth. We face a big problem today, climate change. According to NASA change is a change in the usual weather found in a place. This could be a change in how much rain a place usually gets in a year. Or it could be a change in a usual temperature for a month or So climate change is basically the changing of the climate. How refering it is the change of climate from the human action on the earth such as pollution contributing to climate change and many other human caused actions. Climate change has been a debate ever since the end of the 20th century. It has recently been receiving a lot of attention after the 2016 election and it does not seem like the issue is going to simmer down anytime soon (just like the temperature). With many on each side arguing over the fact that is it a hoax or is it a real occuring problem I come here today to propose a compromise between two big stakeholders in the conversation. The Greenpeace Organization and These are two major stakeholders that are at odds with each other in a sense. The Oil Companies want to increase their profits more than help the environment and Greenpeace wants to solely help the environment. The only problem is is that the Oil Companies are the ones contributing to climate change and the greenhouse gases we see today. If these two could compromise we would likely see an end to the overall discussion of the topic. Oil companies share a big part in the discussion of climate change. They have a lot of money and have a big sway with lobbyist and others in order for them to profit. Oil Companies will say they are not a big part in human climate change. They say they are for the environment as much as anybody else. According to one of the leading companies Chevron, recognize and share the concerns of governments and the public about climate change. There is a widespread view that the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs) is a contributor to climate change, with adverse effects on the They basically are stating that they understand the concerns of the government and the people and they want climate change to get out of hand as well. They express concerns over polluting and global warming when they come out and talk about it. Many other companies such as Exxon/Mobil, Shell, and multiple others realize that the burning of the oil they are producing is leading to higher levels in greenhouse gasses which increase the temperature overall. So for the most part the oil companies address the concerns about climate change. What do the oil companies actually do to prevent climate change? Some companies like Exxon/Mobil have gone out and said that they would prefer to tax the burning of carbon and the fuel in order for there to be a reduction in carbon burning adding to the greenhouse effect. Also many companies like the ones I have already mentioned are trying to find new technology in order to make cleaner extraction of the fossil fuels and less harm to the environment once they are being burned. Even though many oil companies say they care about the environment and stopping global warming there still seems to be increasing in burning of fossil fuels and hotter temperatures. Greenpeace is one of the bigger stakeholders in the conversation of climate change. There goal is to help reduce and find an end to human made climate change. Taken from website they say, devastating impacts of climate change are clear. Our world is warmer than ever before, and people and wildlife are already suffering the consequences. But nothing compared to what leaving future generations if these trends continue. time to stop the destruction. time for an energy Greenpeace wants to truly stop the way climate change is going and they understand the problems with the environment the most out of the two stakeholders. They are the most active when it comes to helping the environment. Greenpeace believes that fossil fuels are major contributors to global warming and they seem to understand the effects more of climate change. As the temperature rises from the greenhouse gases increasing in our atmosphere the ice will melt causing the sea level to rise. Greenpeace fights for the justice of the environment and they also fight for the people who need the environment. Greenpeace has had numerous campaigns and rallies in order for the world to understand the environmental issues that the world faces. The debate on climate change is very hard to understand at times. While, it might seem confusing due to who sides with who you could always come up with a compromise to understand and help the main goal both are going for. Mainly the oil companies say they are for the environment but it is obviously undermined by the profit they make. Since the increasing temperature and problems with our climate I think that both groups can see the outcomes of living such a way. I think that if both sides of the conversation can reach an agreement I believe that we could move forward in the process of stopping climate change. Both groups agree on it being a problem for the environment so I think if we could find a cost effective way by implementing new technology into the oil industry we could get cleaner products meaning a better price for the companies. I think this would work because the oil companies would not be having to reduce their profit as much as they normally would and it would still help greenpeace by making the environment cleaner than before. This would be a compromise that I think both groups would settle on because both of their main goals would be getting closer. Also if greenpeace could work with those companies to start advertising to be cleaner sources of energy they could help more people use cleaner fossil fuels while the oil companies would be making profit which would incentivize the oil companies to do so even more. Climate change is a problem that the world faces today. We must act in order to keep the world clean and sustainable. With the increase in fossil fuel use in the world we must realize that these habits can not last forever. The climate is an important part of the world and we must fight to maintain it. The conversation continues until we end the problem. Greenpeace and all the Oil Companies need to have a compromise that can benefit both of the groups in order for our environment to heal. If you think they should do so you should contact greenpeace or join the movement at greenpeace.com in order to help keep the progress going. References: 1.) Dunbar, Brian. What is Climate  .
