Selmeci 1 Juliette Selmeci Instructor Mariama Changamire ENC 1102 18 April 2017 The Drinking Age in the United States On July 17, 1984 the National Minimum Legal Drinking Age Act became a law, officially changing the drinking age in the United States from eighteen years of age to twenty one years of age (Liebschutz 1). Even though alcohol consumption is illegal for people under the ages of twenty one it has not stopped youth from participating in the drinking culture. In fact, statistics have shown that people from the ages of twelve to twenty years of age drink eleven percent of all the alcohol consumed in the United States. Alcohol is the most widely abused substance among youth (Siqueira 718). Approximately eighty percent of college students consume alcohol. Approximately half of college students, who drink, also consume alcohol through binge drinking. Binge drinking is defined as a pattern of drinking that brings a blood alcohol concentration to 0.08 grams percent or above. This occurs when men consume five or more drinks, and when women consume four or more drinks, within a two hour period (Jennison). Studies have shown that young adults are more susceptible to addiction, dangerous risk-taking behavior, reduced decision-making ability, memory loss, depression, violence, and suicide when consuming alcohol. The National Minimum Legal Drinking Age in the United States should remain twenty one years of age because studies have shown alcohol consumption can be harmful on the developing brain. Selmeci 2 Alcohol is a dangerous substance to consume as it affects the mind and can interfere with a judgment, rational thinking ability, and health. Alcohol use can result in permanent brain damage; serious mental health problems and alcohol dependence or alcoholism (Public Health Agency). The use and abuse of alcohol can interfere with the communication pathways, weaken the immune system, cause cancer and has been associated with sixty diseases. Studies have shown that alcohol has been associated to suicide with sixty five present of suicides related to heavy drinking (Public Health Agency). Alcohol has a strong effect on people and understanding the drug can be difficult; however, it is easy to see that drinking is a problem for everybody because its effects can be felt by everyone, even those who consume alcohol. Underage drinking can cause injuries and even death for not only the one drinking, but also for someone nearby. Every fifty three minutes someone dies in motor vehicle crashes that involve an alcohol-impaired driver the equivalent of twenty eight people per day. In total, Alcohol use is responsible for 88,0009 deaths each year. Alcohol use is the leading preventable cause of death in the United (NIAAA). On the other hand, some people believe that if the legal minimum drinking age was decreased to eighteen years of age, it would better encompass our civil liberties since people are legally considered adults at the age of eighteen and given the responsibility to vote, serve on juries, and be prosecuted as an adult, smoke cigarettes, get married, sign contracts, and join the military, but not allowed to drink alcohol. people also oppose the twenty one drinking age because by prohibiting young adults from drinking in places such as bars and restaurants that causes underage people to drink in unsupervised places where binge drinking and other unsafe behavior is more likely to occur. However, allowing young adults to drink in a so called Selmeci 3 environment does not in fact reduce the rates of alcohol related blackouts, sexual assault, and alcohol poisoning. Something needs to be done, and something can be done considering that underage alcohol use can be prevented. In day and age, the environment we live in is very accepting of alcohol use and abuse with drinking seen in TV shows, shows movies and advertisements. With alcohol becoming more readily available to purchase with liquor shores posted on every corner an increase of drinking usually occurs within that area (Kuo). Since, children usually start drinking as early as thirteen to fourteen year of age, early education is important; thus, society needs to stop accepting underage drinking because it is often viewed as something that is part of growing up and start discouraging it as proper education of adolescents can be extremely helpful in allowing young people to understand the repercussions and consequences that can occur because of excessive alcohol consumption. Today, underage drinking is an epidemic that occurs all across the nation. A change needs to be made in how young adults view drinking culture. In order to achieve this change, motivated people need to get involved and take action. This begins with educating people on the dangers the alcohol can have. Hopefully, by providing people with the information, facts and tools to take action, the amount of underage drinking that occurs can be reduced and ultimately prevented.
