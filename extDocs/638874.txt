Lauren Pircher ENC 1102 Ms. Theodosiou Jan. 29, 2017 Project 1 Intermediate Draft: The Debate on GMO Labeling GMO labeling is a heated and controversial topic that the government and public consumers are debating. Since 1980, genetically modified organisms also commonly referred to as, GMOs, have begun to change the way food is made and in 2012 a non-GMO movement emerged to require mandatory labeling of genetically modified organisms. Major food corporations greatly opposed this proposition as they believe it is unnecessary and falsely alarms the public (Bain and Dandachi 9457). For years we have consumed foods with unknown chemicals and produce from crops that have been sprayed with herbicides in order to prolong their shelf life. Growing concerns from consumers and scientists has led to a spark among the public about whether or not genetically modified foods should be labeled. The American Association for the Advancement of Science and Consumers Union are two organizations in opposition regarding the debate of labeling GMOs. The American Association for the Advancement of Science also know as AAAS, is an organization that is dedicated to advancing science through engineering and innovation for the benefit of all. Regarding the topic of labeling genetically modified organisms, AAAS is strictly against the proposition as they believe it is not necessary and does more harm than good. On the other hand, Consumers Union is an organization that is committed to assuring food safety and believe that consumers have a right to know what is in their food. Despite the controversies these organizations present, a compromise can be made in order to satisfy both parties and their missions. This compromise would be made to benefit both organizations with the agreement that each company would be sacrificing. Consumers Union (CU) is an organization that has been an advocate of food safety and policy as well as a leader on issues that affect consumers food choices such as GMOs, pesticides, use of antibiotics in factory farming, and BPA in food packaging. Consumers Union has been working for the benefit of consumers for over eight decades. Consumers Union strongly believes that consumers have a right to know what is in their food and want manufactures to make products that are safe, reliable, honest and fairly priced (Consumers Union). Consumers Union supports the proposition that genetically modified organisms (GMOs) should be labeled in order to allow consumers clarity and transparency in terms of food choices. The Consumers Union organization claims that GMOs are more harmful than conventional foods stating, produced through genetical engineering are significantly different than conventional foods, pose potential health risks and increase herbicide (Consumers Union). In addition, this company hopes to pass consumer protection laws in the states and in congress (Consumers Union). According to an article written by Marta Tellado, is a simple and common sense solution to protect consumer (Tellado 1). The company is campaigning to require mandatory labeling as they believe all consumers deserve to know what is in their food and/or products. Tellado also states that the cost of labeling would come out to less that a penny a day, a cost many large corporations can handle (Tellado 1). On the other hand, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) is an organizations that greatly opposed the proposition of labeling genetically modified organisms. AAAS was founded in 1848 and is the largest multidisciplinary scientific society. They are the first organization to promote the development of science and engineering at the national level. Stated as their motto, The American Association for the Advancement of Science seeks advance science, engineering and innovation throughout the world for the benefit of all 1). This organization is against the labeling of genetically modified foods as they believe that genetically modified foods are not harmful in any way and therefore do not need labeling on products. According to an article written by the American Association of the Advancement of Science, foods containing ingredients derived from GM crops is no riskier than consuming the same foods containing ingredients from crop plants modified by conventional plant (AAAS 1). They also believe that labeling will only serve to mislead and falsely alarm consumers (AAAS 1). The American Association for the Advancement of Science also believes that labeling genetically modified foods is a costly and unnecessary component of the food industry (Hemphill and Banjeree 438). Stated in an article by Bain and Dandachi, US Food and Drug Administration, the government agency responsible for food safety of GMO crops, has determined that GMO foods are substantially similar to non-GMO foods and therefore labeling is not and Dandachi 9457). The American Association for the Advancement of Science supports companies such as Monsanto, who work to provide farmers with sustainable agricultural products and solutions to help farmers with better harvests. Monsanto uses genetically modified seeds and other modified products to help sustain crops better and more efficiently than conventional crops. The American Association for the Advancement of Science believes that the use of modern technology and science can help to advance products such as GMOs and allow for less harm on the environment (Monsanto). Although both these organizations have obvious disagreements, there are common goals shared between the organizations. Consumers Union and the American Association for the Advancement of Science both believe that safety is the most important concern regarding genetically modified organisms. Consumers Union also urges the public to research genetically modified organisms further to reach a firm conclusion. With each goals in mind, a compromise can be made to satisfy both of the organizations missions and with sacrifices being made on both sides. A solution to this disagreement would to use the American Association for the Advancement of research skills to further examine the issue and safety of genetically modified foods and to label any genetically modified products that are found to present a direct harm to consumers. In doing so, Union would have to contribute to the cost of the research thusly losing money in hopes of promoting and eventually passing labeling laws for GMOs. The American Association for the Advancement of Science would have to agree to honest research and agree to require labeling laws for any genetically modified foods that present a demonstrated risk for consumers. With this compromise both organizations are sacrificing, but also benefitting making it a fair and equal solution to the disagreement. Overall, the disagreement between Consumers Union and the American Association for the Advancement of Science may never officially resolve, but a compromise can be made for both organizations to look past their differences and come together for the benefit of the public. Promoting further research on genetically modified organisms will not only satisfy the Consumers Union organization by achieving their wish to have GMOs looked at more closely, but it will also allow for the American Association for the Advancement of Science to gain more knowledge with research on genetically modified foods and their potential harm. If any information is found that presents a direct and demonstrated risk to a consumer, that genetically modified organism is to be labeled in order to achieve transparency in the food industry. If the proposed compromise does not work for the organizations, both parties will be unable to reach their goals and ultimately the consumers will continue to be unsure about the effects of some genetically modified foods.
