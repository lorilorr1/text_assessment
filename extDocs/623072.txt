Rios 1 Dylan Rios Ms. Hanson ENC 1102 1/29/17 Government Surveillance Government surveillance has become a growing concern for many people over the years. Ever since the 9/11 attacks the power of the government to monitor its citizens has grown. Government agencies such as the National Security Agency (NSA) have given the reason that these new measures have been put in place in order better protect American citizens from future tragedy. This is a noble goal but many people are divided on how to achieve this goal. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is one such organization that wants to protect Americans it aims to do so in a way that is contrary to the beliefs. The main goal is to protect people from the government by defending their privacy. Both organizations want to protect Americans but their methods are very different. One possible solution that could appease both sides would be to allow the government to continue its surveillance but make it necessary for people to be informed that they are being surveilled and given the reason as to why. The National Security Agency is a government organization that has the job of protecting America from foreign and domestic threats through the use of surveillance and information gathering (NSA). The NSA believes in protecting the 4 th Amendment which protects Americans from unreasonable searches but it also believes in preventing possible threats before they can cause harm to Americans. This protection happens through constant surveillance of millions of Rios 2 people all over the world which also means that Americans are being watched as well. This surveillance takes the form of monitoring phone calls and emails for key words that could uncover potential terrorists. The NSA believes that this surveillance the of the American people while being minimally intrusive in private live (Petcu 126). In order to prevent the surveillance from violating rights the NSA makes sure to delete all collected information that is deemed not to be a potential threat. While this still may lead to abuse of the system the NSA believes that the positive aspects of the surveillance outweigh the negative. The Electronic Frontier Foundation also wishes to protect the American people but it is trying to do so by stopping government surveillance. It is trying to do so by bringing lawsuits against the government for its surveillance and promoting technologies that subvert government information gathering. From the perspective the government is the biggest threat to privacy for the American people so they are using any resources possible in order to protect from government surveillance. The reason they feel this way is because when information was leaked on the surveillance practices of the government in 2013 it was found out that people were having their information recorded of whether they suspected of any (Robis 205). While the EFF acknowledges the possibility terrorist attacks they feel that autonomy, anonymous speech, and the right to free are more important (EFF). In the larger discussion of freedom vs security the EEF believes that freedom is something that should be defended at all costs. The National Security Agency and the Electronic Frontier Foundation both believe in protecting the American people from threats even though their methods differ greatly. While their beliefs seem nearly incompatible there are still ways for them to meet in the middle and Rios 3 compromise in a way that can satisfy both parties. One method of compromise that would be mutually beneficial would be if it was required for the NSA to get a warrant before they could surveil American citizens. This would improve their image in the eyes of the American people and it would not infringe on their surveillance of people from foreign countries. This would also further the cause of the EFF by restricting the powers of the government to gather private information on their citizens. Another part of the compromise that could be reasonable would be a requirement that would make the NSA has to inform Americans who are being investigated in depth. This would allow people to be able to not worry if the government is secretly watching their every action. This transparency and accountability are in order for legitimate threats to be identified while simultaneously protecting the rights of Americans (Shamsi 9). With security being such an important issue in these times it is only reasonable that various groups of people would feel strongly about the topic. While the NSA and the EFF are very different organizations they still act towards the goal of protecting Americans from possible threats. While their methods can seem contradictory there is enough that they share that can lead to a compromise. If a stable compromise can be reached then both sides can work together to protect the rights that this country was built on.
