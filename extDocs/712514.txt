Sint 1 Aye Aye Sint ENC-1102 Oana Cimpean 4/16/2017 Project 3: Uses of Solar Energy Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) is a non-profit organization that researches and develops education and outreach programs to promote the further development of solar energy in the United States. The organization believes that spreading the different uses of solar energy around the United States would help to reduce global warming. They believe that by enlarging the solar industry, educating about the benefits of solar as well as convincing the business owners about solar would help United Stated to produce clean and affordable energy. Therefore, to spread the uses of solar the organization needs to educate, engage, and empower the business owners to reduce the negative environmental impacts. There are two ways that solar energy generates electricity from the sun: photovoltaic (PV) and solar-thermal technologies. The solar cells are made of silicon that causes electrons to be set into motion which initiates a flow of electricity which is known as The photovoltaic (PV) cells convert sunlight to direct current (DC) electricity. Then the inverter converts DC into AC electricity. The panel sends converted power to the uses appliances and machines. The process repeat. The advanced solar system employ trackers which increase the amount of electricity. For solar-thermal technologies uses heat to create steam to drive an electric generator.

Sint 2 According to the article written by Kandpal, it states that training and education about the renewable energy, solar energy is one of the prime importance because most of the business owners do not have enough knowledge and information about solar energy. That is one of the reason that lead for poor dissemination of renewable energy technologies. Therefore, educating about solar energy is one of the most important factors to success in implementing the solar technology development. The specific objective of the solar energy education programme is giving information about the causes of global warming and greenhouse gases, and what are consequences of these affects. Moreover, the program is also intent to help business owners who show their interest in solar energy and renewable energies by providing information about the benefits and advantages of using solar energy through conferences which can inform the basic concepts, detailed models, performance analysis and evaluation about building solar panel at their business. (Kandpal, 2014). Also, SEIA organization launches national education campaign and training about solar panels that offers lectures and practical training to students, young people and business owners who are interested in producing electricity from solar energy and renewable energies. The SEIA organization states that building solar energy around US is possible and really profitable to business because producing electricity from solar energy is affordable to all the business owners as well as it helps them to reduce their electricity bills. Not only on the hot climate but also solar power system can also be built in the cold climates by using and indirect system and system. Properly designed and installed solar power system can provide approximately 40% to 80% of the needs. Also, the uses of solar at the buildings can saved about 54.64% of the electricity cost over span of twenty-five with minimum initial investment. (Kale, Joshi, and Menon, 2016). In addition, it can also reduce LCC of existing building effectively. Sint 3 (Kale, Joshi, and Menon, 2016). In addition, the climate central organization states that using solar helps to reduce the human impacts on climate change by displacing noxious emissions from the uses of natural resources such as coal, oil and natural gas. Using renewable energy also helps to reduce harmful emissions of Sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. Moreover, using solar can reduce 10% electric-power carbon footprint. So, everyone especially business owners should use solar energy in their business as it is environmental friendly and give advantages in their business. According to the report made by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the uses of solar energy started to develop as it gives advantages to the business owner. Some of the big companies like Walmart, Costco, Apple and etc. are using solar energy and these companies continue to deploy more, reflecting that their earlier investments are good. So, business owner should continue to install solar and business owner who did not have installed yet also should to get a good image that the company is environmental friendly.
