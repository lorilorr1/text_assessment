Shelby Merrell 1 Karen Hanson ENC 1102 4/13/17 The fast-growing topic of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) has taken storm across the country, and has sparked an interest in many parents into what their children are really learning in the classroom. With the current education in process, students are enveloped in a curriculum focused on able thrive in a modern STEM (US Department of Education) With this focus, it surely pushes students into these fields of study, which are a necessity for a society to function and become innovative, such professions like doctors, engineers, and chemists. However, how are the arts incorporated this, even at all? This is the flaw found in the current program, with our students not receiving a well-rounded education and not being shown the possibility of a future dedicated to the arts and design aspect so necessary for others to perform their duties.

A child falling behind in reading deemed nearly as frightening as a young child missing topics in mathematics. For those pushing to incorporate the arts and for those currently pushing for the current protocol, both can agree that the diversity of students in these courses is a priority. As per the US Department of Education, race, zip code, or socioeconomic status should never determine their STEM Along with the inclusivity need for all students, a hope for students even with disabilities is in the works, with the workings of the which stands for Universal Design of Learning. With these being developed, these will one day be brought into the classroom to Shelby Merrell 1 Karen Hanson ENC 1102 4/13/17 create equality for all students. With the incorporation for more girls into the STEM and STEAM initiative greatly increases the equality of the current execution of the curriculum, showing the expanding interest for more women to be into fields such as these. With the STEAM movement growing, it is supported by teachers, researchers, policy makers, students, and and shows promise in being brought into the future. (About) Now how do we change the current path on? Through communication alone, involvement in a education is consistently found to be positively associated with a academic (Parental Involvement) If you have a child of your own, simply scheduling a conference with the teacher or teachers they have could be the first step to your success and tapping into their full potential.
