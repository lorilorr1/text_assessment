Byerly 1 Kelsey Byerly Ms. Campbell ENC 1102.097 February 27, 2017 The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation supports initiatives, such as the Common Core State Standards, to promote preparation for postsecondary education through high-quality learning from K-12. The Common Core Initiative a framework for curricula that allows students to demonstrate both an understanding of higher-order thinking skills and their application within meaningful academic (Sambolt and Blumenthal 6). In order to ensure the academic success of students, the Gates Foundation is seeking to improve the learning process by targeting the development of teaching methods. The Gates Foundation views CCSS as an innovation that allows teachers the freedom to develop materials that aid the learning process. In the first image, a young graduate is pictured with a grin from ear-to-ear, which is attributed to his success throughout his primary and secondary education. The image is captioned to validate the success CCSS guarantees. Teachers working tirelessly are captured in the second image to provide the audience with an understanding of the continuous collaborative effort put into creating an effective curriculum in accordance with the CCSS. The words Know establish the instructors as principal sources of knowledge regarding the education system. Through the values that govern the Gates Foundation, both visuals reflect rhetorical appeals that establish credibility within the organization, emotional Byerly 2 connections that resonate with the audience, logistical explanations, and recognition of timeliness. In the first image, the logo of the foundation can be found in the bottom right corner, validating that the graphic is provided by the Gates Foundation. Credibility can additionally be established by the attire of the young man in the image; he is wearing a cap and gown with words written above him that read Logistically, the young man should be college-ready if he is graduating from high school. After all, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation supports the initiative because all students are prepared to succeed in college and career is at the heart of the Common Core State and Melinda Gates In regards to emotional appeal, the young man in focus is beaming as well as the young man in the background. It is evident both men are proud of their academic accomplishments and are enthusiastic about the next chapter of their lives, postsecondary education. The opportunity to go to college is provided by the tools and teacher collaboration program brought to them by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Their senses of pride evokes a feeling of longing within the audience to achieve the same success because it undoubtedly brings gratification. The words makes the audience feel inspired to meet the standards in order to feel as confident about college as the young men appear in the image. The claim of the argument in the first image is defined as the preparedness for postsecondary education a student gains ensuing the completion of high school. The reason would be under the condition that the student meets the Common Core State Standards at every grade level. So, the unstated assumption offers that most people find it logical that a student would be by the time they leave high school. Reasons such as this provide a Byerly 3 clear connection between completion of CCSS and being prepared for postsecondary education, which is the ultimate goal of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It is important to note that has become increasingly apparent that students will benefit greatly from at least some postsecondary education or training as they prepare to participate in global because competition within the workforce is on the rise (Sambolt and Blumenthal 2). Without proper education, students cannot expect to enter the workforce and compete for high salary occupations. unemployment rate for students with only a high school diploma is 9.4 percent, compared to just 4.9 percent for those who have earned a (Sambolt and Blumenthal 3). The statistical evidence furthermore emphasizes the importance of postsecondary education when it comes time to settle into an occupation. When analyzing the image, there is no direct to but a subtle hint can be credited to the graduation itself. A graduation is symbolic of a academic career transitioning from high school to college. This transitional period is an opportunity to further their education because now is the time to take all they have been taught, courtesy of the CCSS supported by the Gates Foundation, and apply it to the next phase of their life. In the image of the teachers, the logo of the foundation can be found in the upper right corner, which provides credibility that the graphic is presented by the Gates Foundation. An appeal to ethos can be defined as intrinsic authority that comes from the work experience of the teachers. The Gates Foundation is to ensure that there are high-quality instructional materials available that have been developed by teachers for and Melinda Gates ability to adequately explain concepts and ideas to students establishes their credibility; in addition, the successful regurgitation of the information furthermore reinforces credibility because it means they are teachers. As described by a Byerly 4 research study, who possess strong pedagogical content knowledge are more effective than those with content knowledge (Meroni et al). If a teacher acquires a stronger grasp of how to teach more so than the content they are teaching, they are more inclined to have an impact on the learning process of students. In order to achieve an understanding of proper instruction, teachers are able to increase their knowledge through collaboration with other teachers. The Gates Foundation claims that should be a shared enterprise, not an isolated and Melinda Gates This particular ideology is the driving force of curriculum development. The persuasive element of the visual can be magnified by the increasing number of years a teacher develops professional experience. The diligence exemplified by the teachers reveals their unwavering commitment to provide students with proper curriculum to meet the standards. Their persistence encourages the audience to feel confident that the education system constantly has the best interest of students at heart. The image also evokes the feeling of motivation to assist the foundation in any way possible in order to drive the development process forward in a positive direction. The words Know makes the audience feel reassured that education is in the proper hands of those who have first-hand experience with teaching children rather than legislatures who may not have the same experience. The argument proposed in the second image states that Know because of their professional experience. The validity of this statement lies within itself. It is logical to assume that a teacher possesses a deeper understanding of what teaching methods provide the best results in a classroom rather than a legislature or a doctor. The experience gained over many years working within the field is valuable, as it would be in any field, to the continual development of the education system. This very idea is the underpinning of the Gates Byerly 5 Foundation. Once more, there is no direct appeal to timeliness, but a message is evident that education is continuously under development with the growing contribution of teaching methods and tools between thousands of teachers. need of a teaching staff trained and up-to-date is fully recognized as being essential given the constantly changing environment, disciplinary advances and the changing student population (Meroni et al). It is the resilient efforts of teachers that allow education to progress in a manner that is beneficial to future. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation supports the CCSS in hopes of preparing students for the transition to college. The first image depicts a young man equipped to take on additional schooling because of his success throughout his early education. It is evident he carries himself proudly, which is a quality all students seek to possess when leaving their secondary education behind. In the second image, teachers contribute their ideas in a collaborative environment to develop methods that will enhance the learning process for students. The Gates Foundation claims that are the experts on teaching, and they know the most about what works best in the and Melinda Gates The foundation works to withhold this view by providing teachers with the materials and resources needed. Both visuals reflect rhetorical appeals that establish the Gates Foundation through credibility, emotional connections, logistical explanations, and recognition of timeliness.
