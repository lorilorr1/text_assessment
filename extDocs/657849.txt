Mancuso 1 Sophia Mancuso Kristen Rouisse ENC1102 26 February 2017 The Fight Against Animal Abuse Every 60 seconds, an animal is abused (ASPCA). Animal abuse is a subject that touches just about every human heart. Most people are aware of abuse that goes on in neighborhoods, towns, countries, and in the world but are unsure how to help or spot it. The level of abuse varies and the level of combat against this abuse varies as well. Animal abuse just physical abuse of a pet, the neglect of an animal, the overbreeding of animals, animal hoarding and forcing animals to fight. This is only to name a few and sadly many people are unaware of these forms of abuse and neglect that take place every day. Moreover, stray animals and kenneled animals are at very high numbers. 2.7 million animals are euthanized yearly in animal shelters because of overpopulation of strays (ASPCA). The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) is an organization that works to improve the lives of animals through promoting adoption to keep animals out of shelters and increasing laws that protect animals right and prevent animal abuse. One of their most popular ads is a TV commercial known to bring tears to any viewer, showing pictures of neglected animals to sad music while asking for a simple donation to help. The point is to evoke a large amount of pathos and they do it very well. Images 1 and 2 egg on their audience to join their cause in fighting animal abuse and adopting animals in shelters through ethos, large amounts of pathos, kairos, and logos. Mancuso 2 Image 1 is an image you would find posted on large billboards or sprawled across busy city street walls and windows. It has a striking yellow-orange colored background that catches the eye and three images that stand out. Warm colors like this usually are chosen to show passion for something, which that something that is unclear until the viewer looks at the three emphasized images shown as the focal point (Chapman, 2016). These colors are also supposed to be friendly and inviting, basically calling the viewer to look closer, only to find the more gruesome images. The three stand-out images are all unrelated and are meant to confuse the viewer at first. There is no reason for a brick, a bag, and a puppy to be related until the viewer then pieces it together with the help of the phrase below you can imagine, seen Viewers are then hit with an overwhelming feeling of sadness and disgust when they themselves piece together the image advertisers are trying to create. This is great example of pathos. Pathos is an appeal to emotion and is a common tactic in ads trying to get an audience to do something out of sheer feelings created by the ad (Hoffman, Allyson, and Kimber Wiggs). The way the ad is set up catches the attention of the viewer as well as implements a design to involve the viewers mind into it and gets them thinking. Then, the viewer is then drawn to the words below the images once again to find out more about it. you can imagine, seen is written below in bold red letters popping out at the viewer to imagine what more terrible things could be done with the brick, bag and the puppy. They then go on to say that seen There is an extreme amount of pathos being used in this ad. Below that reads year, the ASPCA handled over 65,000 cruelty complaints, 4,000 in New York This is an example of logos. Logos is the appeal to logic, which is to further prove a point trying to be made (Hoffman, Allyson, and Kimber Wiggs). They include this statistic to further back up their claim of animal abuse and Mancuso 3 support their fight against it. The statistic is followed with a website and in the lower left corner is their logo. These two are forms of ethos, an appeal to ethics (Hoffman, Allyson, and Kimber Wiggs). The fact that there is a logo, a credible organization behind the ad, convinces a viewer that it is something they can trust. The same with the website, even if the audience is skeptical, they can visit the site. They reference to the website in hopes that the viewer could help prevent more cases like this, which could be a form of Kairos, an appeal to timeliness (Hoffman, Allyson, and Kimber Wiggs). This reference to the site also is great way to get people to join their cause, which in the end, is what the ad is set out to do. Image 2 is an ad that is found in a magazine or pamphlet. The over layout of the ad is to have the reader interacting with it, which is a way of catching a attention. The background is bright white which allows any colors in the foreground to stand out and become the focal point of the ad (Chapman, 2016). Before the reader pulls the interactive tab back, there is a dog with a shot pointed at its neck with the statistic dogs are euthanized below it. The reader then realizes that this shot is a shot meant to kill the dog, causing the reader to feel sad. This would be again, an appeal to emotion, pathos. The reader then can pull the tab back, peeling away the shot and revealing a red collar around the neck and the shot is gone. The phrase and their website is then shown on the opposing side of the tab. The phrase is an example of Kairos, appeal to timeliness and the website is an appeal to ethics, ethos. Removing the tab and turning the shot into a collar gives the reader a sense of responsibility in a way. They could do the same thing and save a dog from being euthanized by adopting, which is another form of pathos. Overall, this add is great way to inform a reader about kennels and their overpopulation leading to animals being euthanized and to make Mancuso 4 them feel the need to adopt an animal, which one of the ASPCAs missions as an organization.
