Jacobson 1 Taylor Jacobson Maria Theodosiou ENC1102-050 29 January 2017 Intermediate Draft- A Compromise Between NCAA & CAPA on Paying College Athletes One of the biggest debates among sports nowadays revolves around a seemingly simple topic: paying college athletes. Paying them seems fair because of how much they are exploited by big sports companies but even so, that takes away from the fact that they are amateur athletes getting a college education. Two specific organizations involved in the conflict both care for the athletes, and their mission statements reflect this. One organization that most people are aware of is the National Collegiate Athletic Association (or the NCAA), and they are advocating for athletes to remain amateurs, without payment. College Athletes Players Association is another organization that believes that college athletes should be paid for compensation for exploitation and broadcasting of these individuals (CAPA). Although these two organizations disagree on paying college athletes, because of their goals to do what is best for college athletes, they can reach an agreement on giving compensation to the players through better facilities and opportunities rather than salaries. If college athletes were to have salaries, the NCAA, one of the stakeholders in this debate, would be distributing the money for compensation to the athletic conferences. Although that seems like a simple option for people siding with college players, the NCAA, against any sort of salary or compensation, is on the opposite end of the debate. Despite having conflicting views, the NCAA has similar goals to CAPA, which include promoting inclusion and sense of community, respecting others despite differences, and developing leadership among athletes Jacobson 2 (NCAA). The main goal is to support to athletes so that they get the most out of their education along with competition in sports. Because of this value, this organization argues that college athletes need to maintain amateur status an academic environment in which acquiring a quality education is the first (NCAA). Remaining an amateur in the sport would require zero salaries or payment toward the athletes, therefore the NCAA stubbornly refuses any argument for why college athletes should be paid. Paying them would be like treating the athletic environment like a job and the student-athletes like employees, even though the purpose is to get the athletes a degree and an education along with athletic success (Ridpath). Although compensation is desired, college athletes already receive full scholarships to attend school. Universities give athletes the scholarships because of revenue that is brought in by sporting events and broadcasts. The NCAA values and emphasizes student-athletes getting a college degree, and receiving the scholarship money helps them to easily do that. Although athletes receive full scholarships for going to school, the NCAA would not go through the process of paying all athletes, because some would receive more than others, salaries would be complicated and unequal throughout college athletics, and amateurism would be diminished (Jackson). Therefore, the NCAA believes there is no simple way to pay college athletes. Scholarship money amends for just some of troubles athletes are put through so big corporations can earn billions of dollars. CAPA, an organization that is also athlete-centered and focused on their success and well-being, believes that college athletes deserve more than what they are getting for what they are doing. Some of biggest goals are to make each game fair and even, protect the athletes physically, mentally, and economically, and provide them with the resources that they deserve. To achieve these goals, CAPA run protests and events to promote their organization and to get the attention, since they are in control of most of Jacobson 3 the money flow (CAPA). The money the NCAA receives is kept to pay an excessive amount of money to coaches and other employees in the NCAA, and to distribute to companies televising or broadcasting college athletics (Cronk). Most college athletes have no choice in having their face and their name being presented on national television because the media wants to present stories about the athletes and the channels (ESPN, CBS, TNT, Fox Sports, etc.) want their audiences to be informed on the important players of each team. By designating the best players on the best teams, they can hand out awards, produce television shows and documentaries, and share dramatized stories to boost their ratings and their profit. Athletes are forced to spend their time answering the questions, going through photoshoots, and being branded all over the sports world. CAPA believes that because of these productions scrape in billions of dollars, the NCAA should permit athletes to receive some of the profits made for utilizing their faces, names, and some of their personal information (CAPA). Even without the media hounding athletes for good stories or their quotes, CAPA believes that there is another problem associated with not paying college athletes. This organization uncovers that athletic revenues generate over the last several decades have been spent on excessive salaries and luxury athletic facilities while college athletes are denied basic (CAPA). Even players who have some degree of injury, whether a leg or a head injury, are encouraged to play because of revenue generated when important players are on the court or field (CAPA). According to this organization, paying college athletes is absolutely necessary for how much NCAA and sponsors exploit them (CAPA). The NCAA has gone away from some of their values to make the money they need to keep the organization running and to make media and corporations happy and fulfilled. CAPA lives up to their values and goals for the most part, but does not realize the full consequences of Jacobson 4 abolishing the amateur status. While CAPA believes athletes need to be compensated for manipulation, NCAA disagrees, wanting to preserve amateurism. Before discussing a possible compromise between the two stakeholders in this controversial debate, there are common themes to be looked at through both organizations. Both of their overarching themes revolve around making life easier and better for the student-athlete. The NCAA wants athletes to not only succeed in their sport and school, but take away leadership skills and social skills from their time with the athletic program. They value a balanced effort between school and sports, and the scholarship money they receive helps them to do that (NCAA). CAPA also values succeeding in sport and academics, but highly emphasizes the athletic part of it. They both share common values and goals but emphasis on certain parts of the values separates them. The NCAA emphasizes getting an education along with the athletics part. Being an athlete and receiving scholarship money is making up for how much they will be used for media during their collegiate career, but the NCAA values academics because they are playing for a university, not for an NBA team, only designed to bring in revenue. The NCAA wants to preserve amateurism by not compensating for the athletes, therefore promoting college education as well. CAPA emphasizes protecting the athletes while playing their sport and encouraging that injuries and exploitations are made up for through compensation. To resolve this issue or at least relieve some of the tension, compensation can be made possible. The proposal is that athletes receive compensation through the NCAA through using the money to better protect athletes while they injured and to better amenities and opportunities for them. Although CAPA would not be completely content with athletes not receiving a salary, they still would receive extra benefits to keep them safe, healthy, and productive on and off the court (Berry III). The NCAA would have to release some of the money they make and give to other corporations to provide for the Jacobson 5 athletes. While they can still make a lot of money, the athletes need to come into consideration before anything else. They deserve the compensation of being treated in the best ways possible and being provided the best possible resources such as tutors to help further their education as the NCAA would like it, and the best possible athletic trainers and sports psychologists to help further their athletic careers as CAPA would like it (Root). This is a fairly attainable solution for the NCAA, although money and business seem to be the most important things in our society nowadays. If the NCAA shifts their first priority from money back to the athletes, this compromise can be achieved and the NCAA can fall back into their original platform of caring for the well-being. While paying college athletes seems like a huge dilemma between our two stakeholders, the NCAA and CAPA, the real issue stemming from this heated debate is caring and providing for the student-athletes of universities. Protecting them, providing for them, aiding them, and encouraging them helps fulfill both goals of doing what is best for college athletes. Paying them or not paying them are the two main sides in this conflict, but helping the athletes get a great education and athletic experience will help make up for how much money is brought in because of them. These athletes can further businesses, but with the right resources and opportunities, compensation in terms of a salary is not necessary. Although NCAA may be missing out on profit and CAPA does not get the salaries for players, working together to better an environment and well-being benefits not only the stakeholders and their ideologies, but makes for a better, more just world in sports.
