Collins 1 Ashlyn Collins Ms. Ricketts ENC 1101-010 March 1, 2017 Possible Causes of and Treatment Options of Chronic Headaches and Migraines Roughly four to five Percent of the population is effected by chronic daily headaches (CDH). have many different diagnoses including migraine, chronic tension-type headaches (TTH), new onset daily persistent headache, and hemicrania (Alvin E. Lake III et al S8). The correct diagnosis to the type of headache a patient is suffering is crucial to proper treatment of the headache. Due to the fact that there are many different types of headaches researchers are still conducting tests to determine what causes which type of headaches. The advancing data is changing the conversation about what causes headaches and the treatment options for those headaches. Advancing in the understanding of migraines as well as other headaches is very important with the severe nature of the condition; the World Health Organization has even listed migraines as being of the top twenty disabling (Marisa Chang MD et al 9). Through research it has been discovered that many headaches are caused by several different things, one of the possibilities is that there is a relationship between headaches and sleep disorders. Even though headaches and sleeping disorders have been found in the same patients it is still unsure how they relationship really works, do the headaches cause the sleeping problems or is it the other way around. Morning headaches could be caused by several sleeping disorders such as hypoxia or hypercapnia, while Collins 2 sleep disruption could be caused by a primary headache disorder (Thomas Freedom, MD 240). The most common headaches that point towards a sleeping disorder are sleep apnea, circadian rhythm abnormalities, and primary insomnia. Patients who were experiencing migraines where also dealing with extreme daytime tiredness three times more than those who are headache free. Besides the excessive daytime sleepiness severe sleep disturbance was found to be five times more likely in patients experiencing migraine headaches and three times more likely in patients with TTH when compared to headache free test subjects. In a test based on a large chunk of the population, Uhling et al. found that migraine and tension type headaches were significantly related to insomnia symptoms (Thomas Freedom, MD 241). It has been found that there are strong correlations between sleep disorders and headaches. The treatment of one can cause improvement in both conditions as well as the worsening of one condition causing the other to worsen as well Thomas Freedom, MD 246). Although the second article disagree with the first they do have different data to backup their research because the headache they are researching is different. Migraine and are the most common headache in children. An issue arises when trying to properly diagnose these two headaches as they share many clinical features (Jacob Genizi et al. 1). Children diagnosed with learning disabilities also has been diagnosed with mixed headaches, making a connection worthy of mentioning. It has been found that learning disabilities have a higher correlation between migraines then TTH alone. As with the article exploring a correlation between sleeping disorders it has been found that there is a strong correlation but insufficient proof still to truly say one causes another. Collins 3 When it comes to this illness a proper diagnosis must be maid in order to provide the proper treatment options, as each headache needs special treatment. Chronic daily headaches are classified as headaches that last for four or more hours occurring fifteen or more days a month. There are several pharmaceutical treatment options such as muscle relaxants, serotonin agonists, ergots, serotonin antagonists, anxiety agents, and other miscellaneous One example of finding the proper treatment for the headache at hand are patients who experience migraines also experience other types of headaches, some being TTH. These specific headaches respond to Sumatriptan meaning that the headaches root cause is a serotonin deficiency (Alvin E. Lake et al. S8). In Treatment of Migraine they delve more into migraine classification. Primary headache disorders fall into one of three classifications, migraine, tension-type headache, and cluster headaches (Marisa Chang et al. 9). It is important that a patient takes care of them selves after being diagnoses with one of these conditions, which means they need to migraine triggers, get regular sleep, meals, exercise, and avoid Treatment to these diagnoses involves behavioral therapy, acute care, or daily medication to prevent an onset if necessary (Marisa Chang et al. 11). Because proper treatment is of the upmost importance it is critical for patients to understand their condition as well as the severity of that condition. The conversation over time about chronic daily headaches and all diagnosis under this classification and their treatment options is evolving, and will continue to do so as more information about what causes which headaches and what the best treatment options for the headache arise. Finding a solution to this condition is not straightforward and will take more research. Scientists are playing a game of which came first and mix Collins 4 and match in an attempt to decode this confusing prognosis. When each patient is plagued with a different headache with a different starting point a realistic fix seams out of sight but with more research on the topic a solution could be near.
