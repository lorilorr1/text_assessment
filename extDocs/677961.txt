Alejandra Rincon Professor Roth ENC 1101 Animal Testing Animal testing started around the nineteenth century and till this day something that scientists are still using, the question is it ethical? The use of animal testing is very cruel and something that should have been banned. According to the article Flaws and Human Harms of Animal the conditions that these animals are kept in affects the animals in was such as making the frustrated causing an impact on the outcome of the research. With the society we live today and all the advanced technology there are other ways that the scientists can go about testing their chemicals instead of using it on animals. By using this method this can avoid many things that come with animal testing such as one of the biggest concerns that not only is it harming the animals but also the humans due to the fact that it always work. For example, back in the 1950s there was a sleeping pill that was tested on pregnant animals and showed no affect them, however when pregnant females used this pill it resulted deformities in their children. Our hope has already started with Chimpanzees. These animals had been captured and used for testing since the 1920s and finally in September of 2015 Chimpanzees have been banned to be tested on. This is now illegal and no laboratory can test on them any longer.
