Simeon 1 Reneta Simeon Professor Sarah Roth ENC 1101 March 12 th , 2017 U.S. Drug Policy Over the past two decades, the conversation on drug policy in the United States, both foreign and domestic, has seen very few radical changes until recently. Drugs and those who used them have been perceived negatively. Prior to the 1980s, drugs were not a priority for the U.S. government until they became symbols of rebellion, social upheaval, and political (Drug Policy Alliance). In the 1970s, President Nixon increased the size and presence of federal drug agencies but it until presidency that the country began to experience the changes to the system. The 1990s and early 2000s were characterized by the same implementation of programs, laws and agencies against any form of drugs used nonmedically. In more recent years, the country has witnessed a political and social debate about the legalization of marijuana with a few states passing laws to reduce the number of individuals incarcerated for mere possession charges. Although there have been changes, in the past few decades, drug policy has remained steady and unchanging until recent years. President Ronald Reagan deemed illicit drugs enemy number and a threat to our national security (The American Presidency Project). He declares the on and our country goes on the offensive. Drug hysteria and incarceration rates skyrocketed with this rhetoric that was aligned with the drug war. From 1980 to 1997, the number of people incarcerated for nonviolent drug law offenses increased from 50,000 to over 400,000 Simeon 2 (Drug Policy Alliance). Nancy Say anti-drug campaign set the stage for the zero tolerance policies later implemented. A 1985 poll revealed that only 2-6 percent of Americans believed that the drug abuse was the number one problem. That number later increased to 64 in 1989. The Office of National Drug Policy is created in 1989 by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act. It was created to lead legislative, security, diplomatic, and health measures to combat drugs in the right direction. Under the Clinton administration, this directorial office and many others like it became cabinet-level appointments to show an increased level of importance (American Presidency Project). From 1980 to 2000 alone there was a 300 percent increase in the number of individuals incarcerated and the U.S. managed to take the lead as the world leader in mass incarceration (Patten 85). The government and its citizens were at the height of the drug abuse frenzy. The early 2000s were characterized by the continuity of the drug hysteria with increased spending on programs, laws, and convictions related to drug use and possession while substance abuse continued to rise. In the 2000s alone, U.S. federal law enforcement spent over $4 billion per year arresting millions of people on marijuana charges, usually for possession (Bourgois 581). From 1999 to 2002, proportion of college students ages who drank 5 or more drinks on an occasion in the previous 30 days increased from 41.7% to (Hingson et. al 256). At the start of the Bush administration, overdose fatalities were rising exponentially. This era witnessed the escalation of the of domestic drug law (Drug Policy Alliance). Approximately 40,000 military-style SWAT raids were performed under his leadership, often for simple misdemeanors. Local and state-level government reforms began to affect the growth of the drug war. Rather than getting more aggressive, the on was Simeon 3 beginning to slow and reach a steady rate of deceleration. Politicians even began to admit that they too used drugs recreationally in their younger years. In the past decade, however, there has been an ongoing political debate about the legalization of marijuana with some states even passing their own laws. Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Alaska, Colorado, Maine, and Massachusetts have all legalized marijuana for recreational use. Prior to this, Strikes sent more people to prison for 25 year-to-life sentences on drug possession than for rape, murder, and kidnapping combined. The new millennium has brought on a shift toward more reforms that expand health- based approaches while reducing the role of on drug policy (Drug Policy Alliance). Over 50 percent of the American population now supports the legalization of marijuana (American Civil Liberties Union). Although the numbers are still high, a smaller number of individuals are being arrested on marijuana charges. In 2009, 858,404 were arrested for marijuana charges while there were only 574, 641 arrests made in 2016 (Drug Sense). In conclusion, the conversation on drugs in America has only seen a few small changes in the past few decades. These changes have usually stemmed from changes in the political administration with more citizen and state-led changes taking place in recent years. Although the country is no longer in political hysteria about drug abuse, there still is a long way to go until the drug reform is over. As Americans make their way into the future, the conversation becomes less about implementing aggressive drug policies and trying to help people with drug addictions in a healthy way.
