Mogollon 1 Alida Mogollon Angelica Aranda ENC1102 Section 032 March 01 st , 2017 CAMY Against Alcohol Exposure It is human nature to fight for rights. Because of this, there has been an everlasting struggle to determine the rights of the younger generation. One of the issues that is often discussed is the drinking age in the United States. There are many organizations that advocate for the drinking age to be lowered, as adolescents receive so many other rights at 18. These organizations also argue that lowering the drinking age would prompt better drinking culture in the long run. The Center on Alcohol Marketing and Youth (CAMY), however, argues that the problem the age at which adolescents are allowed to drink, but the exposure which they receive at a young age. CAMY is an organization that focuses specifically on the exposure that adolescents have to alcohol in the media and through other sources, with the objective of reducing alcohol-related issues in younger generations. Through visual rhetoric, they emphasize the idea that youth exposure to alcohol is what is causing dangerous drinking habits, and they prompt the audience to stop purchasing alcohol that markets on youth. The two attached pieces of visual rhetoric demonstrate position against alcohol marketing. The first image focuses on the effects that alcohol has on young females. The use of the color pink and the word appeals to pathos, a rhetorical device that can be used to help the audience connect with the image (Lee, McKee and McIntyre). Although the image is specifically referencing the effects on alcohol on women, this ad is not just targeted for women. Mogollon 2 Women viewing this can benefit from learning the effects that alcohol consumption has on them and how often women and girls are affected by alcohol. And, because girls are generally portrayed as the more vulnerable gender, it can be argued that CAMY is prompting the men who view this ad to help women. The image of girl casually sitting in her bedroom is one that everyone can associate with, so CAMY is really trying to reach everyone with this image. The first image also appeals to ethos, which attests to the credibility of the creator, in this case, CAMY (McKee and McIntyre). One of the ways in which they do this is by borrowing credibility from Johns Hopkins University. CAMY is an organization founded at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and, because Johns Hopkins is such a renowned university, the credibility of the information on the advertisements is increased. There are also lots of statistics in the first image, which, aside from helping with the credibility of the paper, appeals to logos, as it supplies evidence to claims (Lane, McKee, McIntyre). The second image, much like the first, appeals to pathos, ethos, and logos. When observing the image closely, the large circle in the mirror almost resembles a movie reel with a large, red symbol going through it. This movie reel references the place where children and adolescents are being exposed to alcohol. Through this appeal to pathos, the image is targeting parents, and it is making them realize that the innocent movies and television shows that they are showing their children have negative messages. The big symbol running through the image also appeals to pathos, by making it very evident that this is something that needs to be stopped. Image two also appeals to both ethos and logos in very similar ways as image one. Again, the Johns Hopkins University logo is written along with the CAMY logo, as it establishes credibility for CAMY. And image two has many specific statistics that also support Mogollon 3 the credibility of this organization while also appealing to logos, as it provides evidence for all of claims. As previously mentioned, CAMY is an organization that was created initially to research and reduce youth exposure to alcohol. CAMY now also includes research and public health practices across what they call the for preventing problems with alcohol, which include availability, alcohol marketing, and alcohol Ultimately, their goal is to reduce the number of juveniles who are not only drinking, but who are drinking to an unhealthy level. To accomplish this, they campaign, as demonstrated, and they invest into research to support their claims. Most their research has included monitoring and measuring youth exposure to alcohol marketing, which is shown in both images, as many of the statistics included are specifically about said exposure. Their goal is not only to raise awareness for this exposure problem to adults, especially adults with children, but they have taken concrete steps to help decrease alcohol advertisement. Image two, for example, urges a initiative, in which programs would be placed on a list for which alcohol advertisers could not purchase advertisement. This would help prevent the creation of a drinking culture in little children. Children would grow up with healthier drinking habits so that, even if children were drinking underage, the binge drinking culture be as heightened as it with adolescents. Through images demonstrating the daily exposure that children and adolescents get through ordinary sources, the Center on Alcohol Marketing and Youth was able to successfully argue that this exposure needs to be stopped, or at the very least reduced. They efficiently argue that the excessive advertisement that alcohol companies place on movies and television shows for children and adolescents is creating an unhealthy drinking culture for them. A culture in Mogollon 4 which binge drinking is normal and in which youth are placing their lives in danger. Effectively reducing the alcohol exposure in the media would result in both short term and long term health benefits. Because of this, CAMY urges for parents to not only be aware, but they yearn for a change in advertising. Mogollon 5 Mogollon 6 Mogollon 7 Sources Center on Alcohol Marketing and Youth . CAMY.
