Sell 1 Vanessa Sell Professor Spencer Bennington ENC 1102 29 January 2017 Funding Technology in Schools The Department of Education, DE, and the Homeschool Federation, HSF, both have different perspectives on the issue of technology in school and how it will be paid for. While the Department of Education believes that technology in school would be a solid investment because it could drastically effect the futures of the children learning with it, the Homeschool Federation does not agree with this. The HSF believes that homeschools do not have enough funding to implement the technology. If they were to compromise, the Department of Education would have to fund the Homeschool Federation, creating a better way of learning for all children of all ages. With this compromise, many students will be provided with the tools they need for future success. The U.S. Department of Education has a specific office dedicated to researching the ideas of technology in schools. This office is called the OET, or the Office of Educational Technology. The OET is a governmentally run office that dictates what policies and technological advances go through out education programs. The OET believes that technology is a great force that can bring about change in the lives of our future generation. They also encourage technology for our time because of its many different uses. Technology can help every type of student learn through many different types of programs and software. to realize fully the benefits of technology in our education system and provide authentic learning experiences, educators need Sell 2 to be properly prepared to use technology effectively in their (OET) Also, technology can help with the accessibility of materials, such as internet access and books. The OET describes technology as the world at a fingertips. The Homeschool Federation is an organization of professionals and families that are advocates for the idea of homeschooling and family led schooling. This organization is privately- run, headed by lawyers and professionals that all fight towards the advancement of homeschooling. They believe that the family should decide the thought of education, and the parents should decide what their children get out of schooling. 2012, there were an estimated 1.8 million homeschooled students in the United States, which is an increase from 850,000 in 1999, when estimates were first (OII). A survey was conducted on the reasons why parents chose to homeschool rather than let their children have a public education. The results showed that percent of parents said it was because of a concern about the environment of other schools; 77 percent of parents said it was because of a desire to provide moral instruction; 74 percent of parents said they homeschool because of their dissatisfaction with academic instruction in other (HSLDA). The Homeschool Federation believes that technology can be implemented into schooling but they also think that for this to happen, they need more funding from the government. Technology is an expensive thing to adopt and it should not be the families burden to worry about per the Homeschool Federation. They believe more funding is necessary because it is not just the cost of the technology, there are much more expenses to the idea of technology than most people are aware of. Whereas it may seem as though these two organizations are on different sides of the call for technology, it is however the exact opposite. education stakeholders should commit to working together across organizational and geographic boundaries to use technology Sell 3 to improve American (OET) Both organizations believe that technology should be encouraged in school, and brought upon students as soon as possible so that they can be fully equipped with the learning process. These organizations need to come together and benefit each other so that both of their goals are fulfilled, and that is to educate children with the use of technology. With agreeance, if the Department of Education funded homeschooling more, then the Homeschool Federation would be more acceptable to the idea of technology. The DE can fund the HSF with the original start-up costs of introducing the technology, such as Wi-Fi access. Also, they can fund the HSF with half of the costs for the purchasing of equipment and computers. Thus, creating the pathways for technology to be introduced to a wider variety of students. This satisfies both parties of the compromise, because it allows for the technology to be introduced without a dis-agreeance, which pleases the Department of Education, and it allows all students to have access to technology, which is the main concern for the Homeschool Federation. In conclusion, the idea of technology in education is a controversial topic. It is highly argued over, because of the concept of payment and funding. However, if the Department of Education funds the Homeschool Federation, then there will be no issues over how the technology will be paid for. Which in turn allows the HSF to implement technology into schooling without burden. With this compromise in place, there will be a wider variety of students that have access to technology and they will gain the knowledge they need for future scenarios and higher education.
