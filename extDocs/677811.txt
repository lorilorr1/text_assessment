Chapter 1 * 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 1.43 1.4 a) The number of cellphones is a numerical variable that is discrete because the outcome is a count. It is ratio scaled because it has a true zero point. b) (b) Monthly data usage is a numerical variable that is continuous because any value within a range of values can occur. It is ratio scaled because it has a true zero point. c) (c) Number of text messages exchanged per month is a numerical variable that is di screte because the outcome is a count. It is ratio scaled because it has a true zero point. d) (d) Voice usage per month is a numerical variable that is continuous because any value within a range of values can occur. It is ratio scaled because it has a true zero point. e) (e) Whether a cellphone is used for email is a categorical variable because the answer can be only yes or no. This also makes it a nominal-scaled variable. 1.6 a) Categorical, nominal scale b) Numerical, continuous, ratio scale c) Categorical, nominal scale d) Numerical, discrete, ratio scale e) Categorical, nominal scale 1.8 (a) numerical, continuous, ratio scale * (b) numerical, discrete, ratio scale (c) numerical, continuous, ratio scale * (d) categorical, nominal 1.43 (a) Categorical variable: Which of the following best describes this primary business?

The cumulative percentage for Manufacturer B shows 65% of its bulbs lasted less than 10,500 hours, contrasted with 70% of Manufacturer bulbs, which lasted less than 9,500 hours. None of Manufacturer bulbs lasted more than 11,499 hours, but 12.5% of Manufacturer bulbs lasted between 11,500 and 12,499 hours. At the same time, 7.5% of Manufacturer bulbs lasted less than 7,500 hours, whereas all of Manufacturer bulbs lasted at least 7,500 hours 2.24 (b) The Pareto diagram is better than the pie chart to portray these data because it not only sorts the frequencies in descending order, it also provides the cumulative polygon on the same scale. (c) You can conclude that the branding objective accounts for the largest percentage of 45%. When a mix of branding and direct response is added to primarily branding, this accounts for 84%. 2.27 a. b. The bar chart is more suitable if the purpose is to compare the categories. The pie chart is more suitable if the main objective is to investigate the portion of the whole that is in a particular category c. (d) The reasons for the categories of complaints are and which account for more than 68% of the complaints. The remaining reasons are the which make up less than 32% of the complaints. 2.38 a. b. (c) The majority of utility charges are clustered between $120 and $180. 2.40 Property taxes seem concentrated between $1,000 and $1,500 and also between $500 and $1,000 per capita. There were more states with property taxes per capita below $1,500 than above $1,500 2.88 a. b. (c) The alcohol % is concentrated between 4 and 6, with more between 4 and 5. The calories are concentrated between 140 and 160. The carbohydrates are concentrated between 12 and 15. There are outliers in the percentage of alcohol in both tails. The outlier in the lower tail is due to the non-alcoholic beer with only a 0.4% alcohol content. There are a few beers with alcohol content as high as around 11.5%. There are a few beers with calories content as high as around 327.5 and carbohydrates as high as around 31.5. There is a strong positive relationship between percentage alcohol and calories, and calories and carbohydrates and a moderately positive relationship between percentage alcohol and carbohydrates 2.92 a.

The residential average price of gasoline in the United States is higher in the summer in general and seems to peak in June 2.96 c. c. There appears to be a slight positive relationship between the wellhead price and residential price. d. 2.96 a. (b) There is a downward trend in the amount filled. (c) The amount filled in the next bottle will most likely be below 1.894 liter. (d) The scatter plot of the amount of soft drink filled against time reveals the trend of the data, whereas a histogram only provides information on the distribution of the data. 3.2 a. Mean = 7 Median = 7 Mode = 7 (b) Range = 9 Variance = 10.8 Standard deviation = 3.286 Coefficient of variation = = 46.948% (c) Z scores: 0, -0.913, 0.609, 0, -1.217, 1.522 cont. None of the Z scores is larger than 3.0 or smaller than -3.0. There is no outlier. (d) Since the mean equals the median, the distribution is symmetrical 3.14 None of the Z scores are more than 3 standard deviations away from the mean so there is not any outlier. (c) The mean is only slightly smaller than the median, so the data are only slightly leftskewed. (d) The mean market penetration value is 36.2773 and the median is 38.16. The average scatter around the mean is 13.1969. The difference between the highest and the lowest value is 48.08. 3.18 (a) Mean = 7.114 Median = 6.68 (b) Variance = 4.336 Standard deviation = 2.082 Range = 6.67 Coefficient of variation = 29.27% 3.22 a. (b) Silver had the highest return, followed by gold and then platinum. (c) Silver had a much higher return than the DJIA, the S&P 500, and the NASDAQ; return was worse than the NASDAQ but better than the S&P 500 and DJIA; return was better than S&P 500 and DJIA but worse than NASDAQ. 3.28, (a) Q1 = 4, Q3 = 9, interquartile range = 5 (b) Five-number summary: 3 4 7 9 12 (c) The distances between the median and the extremes are close, 4 and 5, but the differences in the tails are different (1 on the left and 3 on the right), so this distribution is slightly right-skewed. (d) In 3.2 (d), because the mean and median are equal , the distribution is symmetric. The box part of the graph is symmetric, but the tails show right-skewness. 3.38 (a) Population Mean = 6 (b) x = 2.8 => = 1.67 3.42 (a) mean = 12999.2158, variance = 14959700.52, std. dev. = 3867.7772 cont. (b) 64.71%, 98.04% and 100% of these states have average per capita energy consumption within 1, 2 and 3 standard deviations of the mean, respectively. (c) This is consistent with the 68%, 95% and 99.7% according to the empirical rule. d, (a) mean = 12857.7402, variance = 14238110.67, std. dev. = 3773.3421 (b) 66%, 98% and 100% of these states have average per capita energy consumption within 1, 2 and 3 standard deviation of the mean, respectively. (c) This is consistent with the 68%, 95% and 99.7% according to the empirical rule. 3.66 (a) mean = 8.421, median = 8.42, range = 0.186 and standard deviation = 0.0461. On average, the width is 8.421 inches. The width of the middle ranked observation is 8.42. The difference between the largest and smallest width is 0.186 and majority of the widths fall between 0.0461 inches around the mean of 8.421 inches. (b) Minimum = 8.312, 1st quartile = 8.404, median = 8.42, 3rd quartile = 8.459 and maximum = 8.498 B (c) Even though the median is equal to the mean, the distribution is not symmetrical but skewed to the left. (d) All the troughs fall within the limit of 8.31 and 8.61 inches. 3.72 , (d) There is a rather weak positive linear relationship between calories and protein with a correlation coefficient of 0.46. The positive linear relationship between calories and cholesterol is quite weak at .178. 3.74 (d) The distribution of the property taxes per capita is right-skewed with an average value of $1,332.24, a median of $1,230 and an average spread around the mean of $577.83. There is an outlier in the right tail at $2985 while the standard deviation is about 43.37% of the average. Twenty-five percent of the states have property taxes that fall below $864 while twenty-five percent have property taxes higher than $1,633.
