Nguyen 1 Alan Nguyen Emil Smith Composition 1 7 April 2017 Medical Marijuana: Helpful or Dreadful? Medical marijuana can be seen as a miracle drug to many. The reported benefits include treating the symptoms of seizures. In a world where those who suffer from seizures are prescribed medications that can have adverse side effects on their bodies, medical marijuana can be seen as a miracle drug because sometimes the prescriptions do not have an effect on the user. Although support for medical marijuana has gained massive support, there have been ancient civilizations that have used cannabis as medical treatment. The earliest recorded instance was as early as 2900 BC by the Chinese Emperor Fu His. The Chinese Emperor reportedly used medical marijuana to treat illnesses such as headaches. Today however, medical marijuana tends to be a very controversial drug with many claiming the drug can help treat the effects of seizures, while other believe the drug can induce more violent seizures, however experiments and testimonies have for the most part only supported the use of medical marijuana. Although the majority of states have legalized medical marijuana, there is a looming effect where the federal government seems very stern in their decision to ban the drug (Soloman 2016). However, the majority opinion is that medical marijuana is beneficial for children who suffer from seizures. With the numerous amounts of testimonies and scientific research supporting that medical marijuana has benefits in treating the symptoms of seizures, the federal government supported an FDA study at Children in Fort Worth, Texas. The study is centralized around the effects medical marijuana that are known to the federal government via Nguyen 2 the media and experiments conducted (Soloman 2016). Thus, the federal government has supported that medical marijuana has some benefits and is conducting this experiment. The results of the experiment provided evidence that supported medical marijuana as the patients had a noticeable improvement in reduction of seizures (Soloman 2016). These results will play a large role in the federal view of medical marijuana. In Pennsylvania, the use of medical marijuana to treat children who suffer from severe forms of epilepsy is very supported. So much that the Pennsylvania health secretary, Karen Murphy has supported the use of medical marijuana (Smeltz 2016). The Pennsylvania Department of Health has tested the effects of medical marijuana on children and results have been very positive (Smeltz 2016). The results of lowering the amount of seizures have convinced the Pennsylvania Department of Health to create a program which will accelerate the process in which children will receive medical marijuana to treat their severe forms of epilepsy. Such optimist behavior from the Pennsylvania Department of Health can pave the way for other state governments to use medical marijuana to treat their epilepsy. It was known that marijuana can have positive effects in alleviating symptoms in sclerosis and AIDS (Torres 2014). However, more recently the use of medical cannabis in treating children who suffer from epilepsy has created large amounts of media attention. The large amount of media attention has caused the state of Georgia to research more into the anti- convulsing properties of medical marijuana (Torres 2014). The results of the research have revealed that the marijuana plant contains about eighty-five different chemical compounds, but one chemical called cannabidiol (CBD) can play a large role in reducing the amount of seizures (Torres 2014). Nguyen 3 The use of medical marijuana to treat ailments has not been a new phenomenon (Sherwood 2005). The potential use for the drug to treat epilepsy is huge and scientists must take it seriously. The effects of the compound cannabidiol (CBD) can play a huge part in reducing the amount of seizures in a patient according to many researchers (Sherwood 2005). The use of medical marijuana to treat seizures has undeniable proof in the form of the countless amounts of testimonies and experiments conducted. The potential is huge as there could be more illnesses that can be treated or even cured with the drug (Sherwood 2005). With such extensive research on the drug, it is inevitable that there will be time in which the drug will be readily be able to be prescribed by any patient that is suffering from epilepsy. There have been numerous accounts of experiments and testimonies that support the use of medical marijuana in treating seizures, there have been some experiments that support the fact that medical marijuana could cause the seizures to become more violent (Knopf 2004). A group of skeptical scientists decided to test the use of medical marijuana on rats who suffer from epilepsy symptoms. As time progressed, the scientists observed how the rats suffered from more violent reactions once they had seizures. With such compelling evidence, scientists decided to keep the experiment going for another few weeks and observe the rats more closely (Knopf 2004). After weeks of experimenting, the scientists concluded that medical marijuana can have a hazardous effect on seizures and all of the experiments supporting the benefits of medical marijuana need more testing. Like every other drug, medical marijuana can have side effects on the children who use the drug to aid in their symptoms of epilepsy. With the legalization of medical marijuana in California, there has been a huge increase in the number of medical marijuana prescriptions, especially for children (Klein 2010). The effects of using medical marijuana can cause many Nguyen 4 negative impacts in adolescents such as memory, learning, and attention. These three attributes are essential to succeeding in school (Klein 2010). If medical marijuana has a negative impact on these attributes, then the child who is using the medical marijuana will find relieve in their seizures, but their academic career can take a wrong turn. Although the use of medical marijuana can have both positive and negative impacts, the positive effects outweigh the negative effects. There have been more evidence and testimony to support the fact that medical marijuana can aid in the treatment of epileptic seizures. The experiments supporting that medical marijuana can have an adverse effect are too few. There will be cases where the drug could not have an impact or make the seizure worse, but it seems the chances of that are tremendously low. Nguyen 5 Works Cited 1. Knopf, A. (2004).
