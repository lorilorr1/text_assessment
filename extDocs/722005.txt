Kaserman 1 James Kaserman Jewell ENC 1101 25 April 2017 The Economic Benefits of Socialized Healthcare into America Imagine a world where you need immediate medical attention from professionals, but the cost of it would bankrupt you, so you choose to take your chances instead. The idea behind health insurance was introduced to protect hospitals from patients that were unable to afford the level of the care they received. This was a necessary measure because hospitals of the era were operated off a non-profit model. The current system of healthcare insurance is inefficient and leaves large amounts of people unable to access it because of sky-high deductibles and premiums. The push for expansions of health coverage and different systems, such as the single- payer option and tax-based financing options. America would be financially better off and its population healthier, if the government would push for legislation to enact a socialized form of healthcare because it would lead to improvements to care, increased coverage to more populace, and decreasing costs due to a focus towards preventative care. Before the Obama administrator, approximately 50 million non-elderly adults in America have no insurance (Shartzer, et al.) With the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Medicaid was expanded, and increased insurance for populations that were previously denied under the former rules. of the decline in uninsured nonelderly adults ranged from 14.1 million to 16.9 million. The federal Current Population Survey reports a decline of 8.8 million uninsured people between 2013 and (Shartzer, et al.) The bill slashed a Kaserman 2 sizable fraction of uninsured individuals. For example, the federal survey, as mentioned above, also stated, we did see improvements in access and affordability early in the ACA implementation, we would expect additional gains over time as health insurance coverage becomes the norm for more (Shartzer, et al.) This is ridiculous that a country with the amount of power the United States possesses does not have the ability to cover its citizens. A recent study by the Physicians for a National Health System found that 45,000 Americans die every year because they have health (PNHS 1). Any arguments against increasing coverage are hard to support because the above group also cites that other countries that have a socialized system, such as Taiwan and Canada, do not ration care in the way the U.S and do so at lesser costs. A change of healthcare systems not only benefits patients, but also offers doctors incentives as well. Liz Seegart, a healthcare journalist, a true single payer system, such as those in Canada and Taiwan, physicians would not have to worry about multiple contracts, fee schedules, different standards for different procedures or obtaining prior approval of (Seegart) The simplification of the government being the sole entity responsible for payment of healthcare services alleviates doctors of the burden of administrative bloat. This leads to doctors being able to focus more clearly on providing high quality care to patients because it would be the only thing they would have to be concerned about. patient safety and occupational health and safety for doctors and nurses are substantial problems, causing suffering for individuals and costs for the healthcare industry, which is economically pressed already by the large and increasing demands for health et al.) Kaserman 3 The above quote comes from a study conducted by medical researchers at the University of Gothenberg in Sweden and highlights the importance of the physiological health of doctors when providing care to patients. They are only able to achieve improved mindsets through the removal of stress from the workspace. Adoption of new methods that lead to more efficient care, such as the simplifying of health contracts through a change to socialized healthcare legislation plans would ease the pressure on doctors to be competitive with health contracts. According to the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, huge premium hikes have caused businesses and individuals to be subjected to health plans that they cannot utilize and this puts even insured patients at risk of astronomical health bills (AJRCCM 4). Finally, the third benefit of implementing socialized healthcare is the overall decrease in costs for patients. Every country in the world pays less of a percentage of their GDP in healthcare costs, but receive equal or more services than their American counterparts. For example, healthcare cost to its GDP is 11 percent whereas the U.S. cost is 17 percent of the (Johnson) This example is a common argument point because Canada is similar to the United States as socioeconomic and geopolitical neighbor. In addition, Canada covers all its citizens which is a higher percentage than the United States achieves with its current system. see much saving realized through preventive care and the elimination of insurance company overhead and marketing costs and hospital billing costs. A 2008 analysis of a single-payer plan estimated immediate savings at $350 billion per year. Another study estimated savings of $570 billion a (Johnson) Kaserman 4 Canada and other countries can realize that through a combination of a move towards preventative care, which is possible, since people are not turned away because of a lack of an ability to pay, and the theory of large numbers supports that services are capable of being less costly when applied to a larger scale. Per, the study for All: An Economic Stimulus Plan for the Nation explains, and expanding Medicare to cover every person in the country, would create 2.6 million new jobs, infuse $317 billion in new business and public revenues, and add another $100 billion in wages to the U.S. It is important to think of the injection of funds for a socialized form of healthcare insurance as a stimulus for the economy and a way to improve health. There is overwhelming evidence and logical reasoning supports the claim that a healthier population is a more productive force and that helps to offset costs acquired from investment into healthcare. With any argument, there will always be detractors and people that want to destroy your argument because it is in their economic interest, and this argument is no different. There are concerns that the switch to socialized healthcare would increase costs through additional taxes, the quality of care would decrease, and care would be rationed, and doctors would receive less income. However, these concerns are misconstrued and for the most part untrue. They are mere misconceptions and rhetoric that is pushed by health insurance companies because a socialized healthcare environments cuts directly into their profits. Firstly, the cost increases would be offset because individuals and businesses would no longer have to pay for healthcare directly. Secondly, healthcare is already rationed in the United States by the ability to pay, so the argument is weightless (PNHS 1). Lastly, efficient care and preventative care would decrease revenues generated by hospitals, but this would have little to no effect on salaries because the additional money generated goes to the administrative side of the hospital. Kaserman 5 To conclude, America can increase the health of its population and lower the financial burden of healthcare costs, if the government would push for legislation to enact a socialized form of healthcare. This would lead to improvements to care, increased coverage to more populace, and decreasing costs due to a focus towards preventative care. It is important for the new generation to play an active role in the formation of legislation relating to healthcare because the next few years will set the precedent in the United States, if healthcare is a fundamental right or a privilege reserved for those that can afford it.
