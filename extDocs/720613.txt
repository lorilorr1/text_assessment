Al Mamari 1 Waleed Al Mamari ENC 1102 Professor Penuliar 17 April 2017 Marijuana Should Not Be Legalized A person encounters difficult times and circumstances in the life and that lead him to find a way to that can help him to pass the miserable situation that he is going through. There are physical, psychological and spiritual ways can be used in order to deal with miserable situations that face you. In this case, people use different ways in order to stop being miserable and reduce feeling stress and anxiety. For instance, some people use to listen to music in order to feel better or they drink water (Marko, 2015). One weird way that is used by some people in order to feel better is used different kinds of drugs such as marijuana. Marijuana - also known as herb, weed and ganja- is a mixture of dried flowers and leaves from hemp plant (NIH, 2015). As marijuana-users describe their experience with marijuana, once they inhale marijuana they immediately feel mellow, lazy and relaxing (Bonsor, 2014). Therefore, marijuana does help people to feel better and this is a common fact. However, there are side effects for marijuana- short and long term effects- and it has effects on its user and the society and if you can search the negative impacts of marijuana you will realize that it has more hazards than its benefits (Leaf Science, 2016). There are people non-engaged in this issue and they do not care about this matter because they have not used marijuana or they have never met with a marijuana-user in his family or society. However, everyone in the society should realize that using marijuana has been spreading dramatically and estimated 13% of Americans are marijuana-user and this percentage Al Mamari 2 increases by 7% each ten years (Chen, 2016). In this circumstances, everyone should start do care about this issue and get educated about the impacts of this phenomenon. There is a quote prevention is better than this means that people should prevention could be easier than finding the cure. Personally, I think people should stop producing and trading marijuana productions with some exceptions such as the medical-marijuana. In this matter, people should take an action in order to stand against marijuana. Volunteering and joining non-profit associations can be a good action in order to help to reduce numbers of marijuana users. American Lung Association works to help people who use to smoke any types of cigarettes to stop smoking (Moassessi, 2012). Therefore, I can empower people to join like this association in order to stop smoking marijuana. Overall, in order to stop using marijuana everyone should get involved and care about this issue because it is a phenomenon has begun to spread in societies and then they can join the American Lung Association in order to help marijuana-user to stop using marijuana. There are many people that do not have any idea about marijuana and how it can be useful and harmful at the same time. Marijuana is a mixture of dried leaves and flowers from the hemp plant. It has a complex of 400 chemicals that affect brain and body (Rayn, 2009). For instance, THC Tetrahydrocannabinol- is a chemical that works to affect your nervous system and immune system in order to make you feel relaxing (United, 2014). In addition, marijuana is addictive and it can open a gateway for other drugs. Marijuana-user wastes money to buy it and wastes time because once he inhales marijuana he will be relaxing and he will not be able to do anything. There has been a conflict between whether marijuana must be legalized or not. In this case using different types of social media can be the suitable way in order to educate the public. Al Mamari 3 By using social media, it is possible to give detailed information about marijuana. However, the problem is one type of social media can make marijuana a beneficial substance that can help people and other social media types can make marijuana harmful. Therefore, here I am talking about the trustful and credible social media that can give the real information. For example, produce a multimodal argument in website form can give visual and readable information about marijuana. I personally see that social media is the appropriate way to educate the public about the marijuana and its effects. Another way to educate the public is to share real stories about marijuana users and how they suffering. Each person in the society should care about this issue because it might face him/ her. A person would ask himself why I would care about marijuana and I have never tried it. Marijuana can be produced in different types such as cigarettes, sprays, evaporations and so on. In this case, each one should work to advise his family and people around him to keep away from using all types of marijuana. In a statistical way, the number of marijuana user has been increasing in societies. There are 94 million marijuana-user in the United States and this number is increasing by 7% percent each ten years (DrugFreeWorld, 2014). According to the previous statistic, I think that everyone should care about this issue because you might think it is your turn to try marijuana or maybe your son or friend think he should try marijuana because most people smoke marijuana. The point is we should stand together in order to stop using marijuana in societies because marijuana can destroy societies. In this case our duty as human-being to protect the society that we live in. If we think about the actions that we can take in order to stop using marijuana, we have different options that can work to stop trading marijuana. Personally, I think volunteering and Al Mamari 4 nonprofit organizations can be good ways to stand against marijuana. First, how volunteering can help to reduce the number of marijuana- user? Let us think that we have a person who is addicted to marijuana. He can volunteer and show his experience with marijuana to the public and express his suffering with marijuana. This will help to make people feel the dangers of marijuana then they might feel afraid to smoke marijuana. Another action to reduce and stop using marijuana is to establish and join non-profit associations and organizations. Theses organizations offer help for marijuana user to stop using marijuana. They offer lectures and course that help to stop smoking marijuana and they provide doctors can examine marijuana user and help them (American Lung Association). There are ten American Lung Association branches in Florida and they have annual programs to help people to avoid smoking marijuana. This is a non-profit organization that depends on donations and charity. Therefore, like this organization can take a good action in order to reduce the number of marijuana users in societies. In conclusion, the issue of legalizing marijuana has been discussing between people for a long time. If you are supporting legalizing marijuana what are the action you can take to legalize marijuana. On the other hand, if you are standing against marijuana what are your ways to stop marijuana in societies. Personally, I could recognize that marijuana is harmful to people and societies together. In this case, in order to stop society from producing and trading marijuana there are three steps should be done. The first step is to educate the public about the issue of marijuana and how it can be harmful. The second step is for making a difference and taking an action in the society. The third step is to take an action in order to stand against marijuana. Personally, I see that volunteering and nonprofit organizations are good ways that work to reduce marijuana distribution. Finally, the three steps will not work if the society does not come Al Mamari 5 together and collaborate because collaborations is the main point that can push the society towards success.
