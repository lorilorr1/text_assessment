McIver 1 Jasmine McIver Professor Townsend ENC1102 26 February 2017 Intermediate Draft SeaWorld parks were originally opened in 1964 as marine zoological parks Today, they are viewed more as amusement parks with its fun and playful environment. Through their activities, the parks hope to give guests an experience that is not only fun, but help the audience develop a sense of appreciation for the environment around them. One of the main goals is to connect guests with marine life in new ways. SeaWorld has now rescued over 25,000 animals and shelters them between their three locations (SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment). Some of these captured animals include their well-known killer whales. The orcas are kept in captivity and are shown off to the audience through different shows offered by the parks. These shows are used as a way for their visitors to see and learn about the killer whales up close. SeaWorld effectively uses the rhetorical appeals pathos, ethos, logos, and kairos in their advertisements to persuade the audience into visiting their parks. The first advertisement dates back to 1986 and shows an image of a little girl with the biggest smile on her face hugging a killer whale. The caption on the top of the picture states, other day makes you feel this With pathos being the appeal to emotions, it is the rhetorical appeal most used in this advertisement. After looking at the extremely happy young girl, the audience is left to believe that taking any child to SeaWorld will leave them with a smile just as big on their face. For parents, this rhetorical appeal could lead them to reflect on their childhood days. Thinking if they had this much fun at SeaWorld, it would be just as fun taking their kid to McIver 2 the amusement park and experiencing the same amount of joy. The second image shows a little boys shadow touching the glass as he stands and stares at a whale that appears to be the color white through the glass and the water. Written in white, there are three words stacked on top of one another in the middle of the picture that read, Worlds The audience is automatically attracted to the words first as the color white makes the words stand out as it is written over the blue water. Also, the black shadow and the look of the white fish could represent the contrasting worlds and in the case of the second image, SeaWorld San Diego is what brings them together. This advertisement does a good job of following along with the main goal of SeaWorld which is to connect guests with marine life. In both the first and second images the rhetorical appeal of ethos is displayed through the logos included in the pictures. The difference in date between the advertisements shows the evolution of the SeaWorld logo. In the first image, the word SeaWorld is written out with an image of a killer whale leaping over the blue ocean waves next to it. In the similar updated version of the logo, the word SeaWorld is fully written out in with the top half of the words being black and the bottom half being blue. On top of the word is a blue and yellow figure in the shape of a fin. SeaWorld could have incorporated the idea of the original black orca jumping over the blue water into one by making the top half of the word black and the bottom half blue in the new improved version of the SeaWorld logo. With the SeaWorld logo being present in the photos it shows the credibility of the pictures knowing they were released by a reliable source. The second image does also include a website at the bottom of the photo. This gives the audience a place to refer to if they have any questions making it seem a little more reliable. The rhetorical appeal logos is also used in the first image. The short passage in the advertisement includes exact numbers to emphasize the amount of fun and the number of options McIver 3 the audience is given at SeaWorld amusement parks. With the kids, it could show parents the different opportunities they have to put the perfect smile on their face. With logos being the appeal to logic the statement, other day makes you feel this could push parents to take their kids to SeaWorld. If worries and goals are to make sure their child is happy, and according to advertisement number one SeaWorld can do that, then why not take the kid to SeaWorld? With the second image, there are three words lined on top of one another to keep it short and simple. The logic behind the three words Worlds is that through SeaWorld, people can get up close and personal with these animals and give the audience an experience they will not find anywhere else. The final rhetorical appeal which is also discussed in the first advertisement is kairos, or the appeal to timeliness. The image being published in 1986 shows that SeaWorld has stuck to and has been dedicated to its goals of keeping its environment happy and their customers satisfied for years now. Also, in order to obtain its desirable result, it is important to consider where the advertisements should be placed in order to be most effective. The first image would be effective if it was placed on billboards or placed in newspapers or magazines. This way both parents and children would have opportunities to view the advertisements. For instance, with image one, if a child sees the picture they may ask their parents to take them in hopes of experiencing as much fun as the little girl in the picture is. Along those lines, if the parents sees the image they may automatically imagine their child being that happy and take them to SeaWorld as well. The second image would be effective if placed in newspapers or articles read by parents and teachers. Teachers and parents could take their kids to SeaWorld in order to teach the children about the animals in different, close-up ways. McIver 4 Overall, both of the advertisements successfully persuaded people to go to SeaWorld using the rhetorical appeals correctly and to their advantage. They used the rhetorical appeal pathos to get to the emotions of the audience and show that SeaWorld would not only make the family happy, but it could connect the people to the animals. Ethos was used by including the SeaWorld logo in both advertisements showing the credibility of the images. The images used the logos to make it sound reasonable that SeaWorld would make families happy and connect them to the animals in the park. Finally, kairos would be useful in determining the best places to present the advertisements to make sure they obtain their desirable result. Using the rhetorical appeals, the two advertisements could attract more people to the park which would to connect more guests with marine life which is main goal. McIver 5 Works Cited Page SeaWorld.
