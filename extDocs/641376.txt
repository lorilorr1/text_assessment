Student 1 Student Dr. Thornton ENC 1102 12 February 2017 Fight for Affordable Solar Energy Solar energy is a very important topic in society. People are constantly worrying about global warming due to all the pollution happening in the world, but there are many ways people can lower the amount of pollution they create. Traditional forms of energy typically burn fossil fuels, which in turn create harmful gasses that cause air pollution. This leads to global warming, which in short, is bad because it is essentially interfering with the climate system. Solar energy is an obvious, yet effective way of lowering the amount of air pollution in the world. The company SolarCity has one objective, and that is to provide affordable, quality solar panels to consumers located in the United States of America. SolarCity is national leader in clean energy services and #1 solar power (SolarCity) they also claim their footprint per unit of energy production is 95% lower than that of fossil fuel power (SolarCity). The professionalism and success of the company as well as their dedication to stopping global warming is clearly shown constantly throughout their website. Anyone can easily interpret, from the well-organized website, the hard work Solar City has done to provide affordable and quality forms of solar energy. One trip to their website will entice the viewer with short slogans and vivid images of their products in use. These images aim to attract people in the market for solar panels, or even get the attention of people who did not initially consider the use of solar panels. The images used on the SolarCity website use various visual and rhetorical techniques to provide the viewer with an idea of what life with solar energy could be Student 2 like, they are able to connect to the goals of the company and successfully promote their product. One of the pictures on the SolarCity website, located in the powerwall tab under the residential section, clearly depicts the goals of their product. At first glance, the picture shows a house surrounded by dark, gloomy clouds with the caption through any (SolarCity). While the clouds are a shade of dark gray and black and the houses are dull and colorless, the house in the middle shows bright yellow and orange light shining through the windows, this light brightens up the landscaping showing the healthy, green grass. It is instantly shown that the company is trying to tell the audience that, even when there is a power outage, the consumer can still have electricity if they use solar panels on their home. In the middle of the picture is the house, but unlike the other houses on the road, this house has electricity, this further supports their claim in the caption. Overall the picture successfully makes the claim that, in many different circumstances, solar energy will triumph above traditional forms of energy. Along with the obvious messages depicted, the picture shows many kinds of rhetorical appeals, appeals are how rhetoricians engage their (Rhetoric really Matters). Logos is used because it provides statistical evidence stating that the consumer will have 5kw of power to use when there is an outage, when the average home only uses 2kw of power, then it shows a picture of a house with power during an outage. Ethos is used because the photo uses language that is understandable to the audience. Pathos is used because it uses a sense of gloominess due to the storm, but uses a bright, cheerful part of a house in the middle to depict the upside of using solar energy, which shows how solar energy is not harmful to nature, but can also be more helpful than traditional energy. Lastly Kairos is used because of how important power is in society, people need energy to do majority of work, and the ability to get power during an outage is beneficial. Through various forms of visual and rhetorical, this image is able to Student 3 depict a simple, yet valuable message relating to the goals of the company and what they seek to bring forth when the consumer works with them. The viewers of this image would typically be anyone in the market for solar energy due to cost savings, environmental reasons, or even pure curiosity. It is able to tell the viewers that even when there is a storm or other factor that can cause a power outage, solar energy will still be available when traditional energy is not. In the second picture, a nice looking house with solar panels as well as light emanating from inside, is shown. Four people are located on the front porch, greeting each other, with smiles on their faces. Surrounding the house is a beautiful, bight, green forest with bright blue skies and mountains in the back. This picture clearly aims to show how happy and beautiful the world would be if people used solar energy more. With the use of solar energy, these people are causing less damage to their environment and are able to enjoy nature. On the top of the picture there is a caption reading with #1 solar (SolarCity). This further shows how the viewer and or user of products can save money, produce less pollution, and be happier. While the visual techniques of the picture are obvious, there are still rhetorical techniques strategically placed throughout the image. Logos are used because the image claims that SolarCity is Americas #1 solar provider. Ethos is used because of the confidence and numerous claims on their credibility as a company, and how they value their customers. This image has pathos because it shows how happy the people are in the picture (they are around nature and have energy that harmful to it), the use of solar energy does not harm nature either, which helps preserve its beauty. This picture also uses Kairos, the decision between buying solar panels or using traditional ways of energy is relevant in society. Overall this image clearly depicts many visual and rhetorical strategies to attract the viewer to purchase products. These viewers can range from anyone looking for a Student 4 cheap alternative to traditional energy or people who want to pollute the world less. SolarCity is a successful, and impressive company that seeks to provide the best solar energy to their valued clients.
