However, there is also a part in the article in which college graduates discuss how this is not the Garcia 6 case for a majority of people who attend college. The article states how the median student debt is about fifteen grand and can be paid off in a period of ten years.

Jacqueline King goes on saying how higher education is a great investment. The articles also discuss how we ignore the fact that many students drop out of college which makes it difficult for them to pay back these loans. The reason I choose this article however, short it gives students opinions and how paying back loans are not as easy as it seems because it take certain cases into consideration. For example, what about college drop outs?
