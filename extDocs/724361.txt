Rudy Palta Maria Theodosiou Composition 2 April 10th, 2017 GMOs: the wrong solution for starvation GMOs have been a constant growing issue in the community when looking for an alternative food source. Throughout the world, the population is exponentially growing; therefore there must be some form of sustainable food source to allow for the survival of this society. The costs of the production of genetically modified organisms outweighs the beneficial aspects and people must be informed on the subject of GMOs in order to know that there are other alternatives and the community is capable of helping with this worldwide issue. This can be done by supporting the non-gmo project, educating schools, as well as holding fundraising in order to promote the need for a natural food source. The Non-Gmo project is a non-profit organization that is committed to providing alternatives to food in order to promote a more healthy and natural food source (nongmoproject, 2017). This organization feels like everyone deserves the right to know in their food, companies are not forced to label if they contain gmos therefore, this issue must be known of. This organization was established in 2007 by two grocery stores, The Natural Grocery Company in Berkeley, California and The Big Carrot Natural Food Market in Toronto, Ontario (nongmoproject, 2017). These companies wanted to make an effort through the community by educating people on the subject of genetically modified goods as well as selling verified natural goods. The organization has made over 19 billion dollars in sales, making the non gmo project the most trusted in gmo avoidance (nongmoproject, 2017). Moreover, Genetically modified organisms have the capability of positive effects for society however, there are limitations to the outcomes and it has the potential of causing more harm than good. Some of the positive effects of the production of GMOs is that it will allow for a stable source of resources and food, causing a decrease of starvation throughout the world. The only issue with this is that people fear the unknown specifically the unknown effects of the consumption of gmos. Also people feel like it is unethical to manipulate the genetic material of animal since it can be seen changing a creation of Farmers would be affected very drastically since they will have to compete with the monopolist firm Monsanto, the largest distributor of genetically modified goods. Monsanto has the capability of manipulating the price of seeds in the market, making farmers pay a ridiculous amount of money as well as making farmers pay if genetically modified seeds fly on their property. This then destroys much of the local agriculture causing the overall production of the economy to decrease. These farmers work hard in order to make a living and are important stakeholders for the nation, therefore farmers should be helped in order to promote this natural food source instead of being punished for something they may have no control. Genetically modified organisms are also capable of having a drastic environmental effects due to the different characteristics that are manipulated. If these creatures were to escape into any ecosystem, they are capable of tampering with the food chain and can possibly cause overpopulation or a scarcity in the ecosystem. The pesticides used for genetically modified crops allow the plants to be more resistant to most pests and natural disasters. This would be a good solution for less developed countries that experience droughts or erosions however, these pesticides are capable of killing important animals in the ecosystem such as the honey bee (Stapleton). The honey bee pollinates flowers and plants allowing them to grow and flourish, providing resources for society therefore, their extinction has a dramatic impact on us and this is we should stand up and make a difference. In order to help inform the public of this issue and make a change people can support organizations that promote sustainability such as the honeybee conservancy who deals with the safety of these insects (honeybee, 2016). This organization brings the bees to classrooms and educate young children on the science behind pollination, allowing children to understand the importance of the organisms around us and providing them with a view on the issue. Speaking to a state senator is also a good method of creating change since they are the representative of that sector, regulations on the amount of pesticides or the potency can be created in order to protect these animals as well as ensure the safety of our own food source. A study was done on the Monsanto firm after a pigs experienced deformities due to the modified food they consumed, this study was conducted by a group of Phd scientist who wanted to analyse the plausible cause for this issue and if GMO products are actually safe to consumer (Gale, 2015). Plausible health risk from the consumption of gmos range from infertility to cancer, more research must be done in order to know all the possible effects of the consumption of this good (Wang 2017). Another issue of these pesticides is that over time these insects will adapt in order to become more resistant to the toxin therefore, it is going to be much harder to eliminate pest the more these pesticides pollute the world. Furthermore, change cannot occur without the help of the community and there are multiple ways to do so that take little very effort. Many conservation organizations promote projects in order to educate the public on genetically modified organisms and other issues. With the money from donations these organization are capable of maintaining and reaching their goals, helping improve the quality of food in society and ensure the safety of the lives of millions. Much of the food that is in grocery stores get thrown out because they have minor issues with the way they look, making the food seem unreasonable to eat, even if it is perfectly fine. This is one reason why United States is known for wasting the most food, this can change if everyone went to their local supermarket and provided them with their opinion on the topic. This would lead to a much larger food supply and lower the amount of starvation that is around the world slowly but surely. Genetically modified organisms are merely just a temporary solution but even as a solution it contains multiple flaws. Protesting can be another manner of spreading the word, by demanding to know the manipulation of our food we are capable of making a choice on whether we want to eat it or not. Giving consumers the choice to choice whether or not they want to eat gmos or not. Fundraisers and volunteering programs can be created in order to help farmers grow their crops in order to help the sustainability of our food source. This would allow them to help reach consumer demands and also allow them to have some potential to compete with large firms such as Monsanto. In conclusion, the topic of GMOs is an important discussion and people should make an attempt to create change in order to have a sustainable society that will last for several centuries. There are multiple ways for people to become involved in the solution it merely takes some time and effort, becoming involved and learning about the issues going around the world allow for citizens to be more integrated in the community and allows them to express their values which could help develop new methods of production. There is only one planet in which we live in, which is why we should attempt to preserve and maintain what we will need to survive. Work Cited  Non-GMO Project. N.p., n.d.
