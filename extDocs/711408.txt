Student 1 Student Professor Stephanie Derisi ENC 1102 16 April 2017 Privatization: The Battle for Profit or Well-Being Veterans from the U.S military, being both those who are retired and are currently serving, receive health care benefits for their service to the country. Though their benefits seem to be top-notch, there are actually several downfalls which have created the controversy of privatization. Privatizing veteran healthcare would mean that their care is not funded by the government, but rather private investors instead. One of the biggest reasons stakeholders have argued for privatization is because of an incident in Phoenix, Arizona in which over 300 veterans died because the wait times for the were too long. Privatization is opposed by many stakeholders such as The American Legion, Disabled American Veterans, and VoteVets.org because they believe it will hurt the veterans in the long-run. It is important for non-engaged stakeholders to adopt this position as well because Veterans give their time to defend the U.S.A but are constantly short-changed with benefits regardless of their service. Kairos- The American Legion is a non-profit organization created in 1919 that serves to support Veterans Affairs. This stakeholder has argued against privatizing because they have been able to improve the poor healthcare situation on their own. According to the website in an article against privatization, were the first to call for the resignation of VA Student 2 Secretary Eric demonstrating their effort to improve the situation without private addition(Barnett). Pathos- Logos- One of the biggest reasons privatization should not occur is because are geared toward military related injures. Thus, private care facilities will not be able to provide for veterans properly. The battle for privatization has been ongoing for years but there is one angle with more support. Veterans should not have private healthcare because are better trained, it leads to higher cost, and majority of veterans do not want it. Veterans have taken the time to serve their country, but the country has not taken the time to serve them correctly. With combined efforts, privatization will no longer be suggested and Veterans will have top-notch healthcare for the future. In order to support veterans as well as their stakeholders, the petition against privatization from votevets.org needs to be signed. Veterans are dying by the hundreds, and all it takes to stop it is getting involved. Student 3 Works Cited Augustine, Garry J. Op Ed: Vets Do Not Want the VA  The Military Advantage Blog.
