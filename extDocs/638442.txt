Echeverria, #!1 Javier Echeverria Emil Smith Composition I January 29th , 2017 Ethical Debates of the use of Genetic Engineering Since its conception, genetic engineering has always been a controversial topic. This is attributable due to ties with eugenics which was prominent during the Nazi regime in the Following the Second World War, this science had a relatively quiet period but experienced a resurgence in the when researches saw the benefits of modifying the human genome. Soon scientists possessed the capability to eradicate genetic diseases in human embryos that could present harm during the embryos lifetime. Currently, one of the main purposes of genetic engineering is implementing of specific genes from some species to other to enhance their capabilities. One example is the implementation a bioluminescent gene in trees with the intent of conducting them to glare at night thus reducing the use of electricity to illuminate certain areas. Despite the benefits that genetic engineering presents, there exist arguments that question the use of this science. Many of these arguments question how the modification of the human gnome can affect a human throughout their life time. Other concerns come from an ethical standpoint questioning what authority humans have to interfere with the natural state of species. This leads many to consider if the use of genetic engineering for the treatment of genetic diseases and interchange of genetics between species is ethical?

Web. 24 Jan. 2017. <http://www.actionbioscience.org/ biotechnology/glenn.html>. Genetic engineering is defined as the use of techniques to modify an organisms genetic make up. This usually occurs by removing genetic material from an organism to add it to another. This is possible largely due to the similar genetic sequences that exists in all species, in return, the transgenic organism can adopt the new genetic material with no problem. Currently in the field of genetic engineering, many developments to further the practice. In one instance, a subdivision of the topic called transgenics, allows scientist to develop organisms that have genes not found in the species. A popular development occurring in this field is the plant Here, scientist implant a gene from a firefly into a houseplant which creates plants that provide a soft illumination in the darkness. One of the goals is to create trees that could glow in the dark providing light to streets and pathways, thereby saving energy. Other areas being developed include genetic manipulation of stem cells by growing tissue with a 3-D printer. Despite the many benefits of genetic engineering, there exists many ethical issues associated with it. Some social concerns include questions such as will have access to these technologies and how will scarce as medical advances and novel treatments be Echeverria, #!3 One popular ethical debate is the concern of species boundaries. There are many controversies associated with genetic manipulation of species. Many people believe that it is immoral, against the laws of nature and that species boundaries should be fixed and not intertwined. Others believe that these boundaries are just boundaries placed by humans where in actuality many species mate with other species creating hybrids in many cases. Despite this, there exists several known risks associated with the transplantation of cells or organs from animals to humans for medical reasons.. For example, there is a small but significant risk of the transmission of usually fatal zoonotic diseases, such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (aka cow The article Ethical Issues in Genetic Engineering and Transgenics by Linda McDonald Glenn, address all the different perspectives in the debate about genetic engineering. This article relates to the research question because the author discusses the ethics associated with genetic engineering. Glenn mentions the arguments that stand on the premise that genetic engineering is beyond the authority of humans to interfere with nature. Throughout the article, it is easy to tell that the author contains expertise on the science of genetic engineering. Linda McDonald Glenn is a bioethicist who has held faculty appointments at California State University and the Alden March Bioethics Institute at Albany Medical Center. he has also taught at the University of Vermont College of Nursing and Health Sciences, and the University of Sciences in Philadelphia, Department of Biomedical Writing. She is also a Fellow of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies and a Bioethics Project Bioethics Project Scholar. Echeverria, #!4 Source #2: Sivapatham, Renuka. Ethical Implications of Human Genetic  SAGE. Buck Institute for Research on Aging, 19 Aug. 2015. Web. 24 Jan. 2017. <http:// sage.buckinstitute.org/ethical-implications-of-human-genetic-engineering-2/>. DNA editing techniques have been available for a few decades allowing scientist to understand gene functions and molecular pathways. Recently there have been many developments in the field of genetic engineering that has allowed a faster and more efficient way of modifying gnomes. Some of the techniques that allow this are either the Zing Finger Nucleases, Transcription activator-like effector nucleases and most recently the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic repeats. The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic repeats is the most recent of the techniques and offers the most advantages. One way it serves as a more advantageous procedure is the fact that it makes it easier to target a specific gene and it is often more proficient in generating the desired recombination results. Currently this techniques of genetic engineering are having so much success that human trials are currently being done in Human Laboratory in China. In the Human Laboratory, scientist were able to genetically modify embryos and remove a mutation that hat causes the blood disorder thalassaemia. Despite the positive effects, the use of these procedures is highly regulated in the United States. In one instance, the US National Institute of Health (NIH) director, Dr. Francis Collins, released a statement emphasizing the policy against funding research involving genome editing of human embryos and the ethical concerns regarding this technology. In regards to the ethical concerns, it seems that the international committee has already agreed that the use Echeverria, #!5 of genetic engineering for the prevention of mutations and diseases in embryos is inevitable. The complications arise when this science is used for cosmetic reasons such as changing eye color or even enchanting some athletic traits. This is where skeptics ask are we to manipulate However, it so simple for people who suffer from these genetic diseases. If it is possible to prevent genetic diseases and create healthy humans, why not manipulate genes? The author is able to relate to the research question because she considers all the ethical issues associated with genetic engineering. In this specific article, Sivapatham provides ethical reasons for why we should encourage the use of genetic engineering. This is illustrated when she describes the help needed by those who suffer from genetic diseases such as muscle dystrophy. The author Renuka Sivapatham has great expertise in her field. She completed a Bachelors and Masters of Science in Molecular Biology from Aarhus University. She is currently completing her PhD at the University of Denmark and has published various peer reviewed scientific articles for organizations such as the PLoS One and and Stem Cells Reviews.

Echeverria, #!6 The research paper Public Concerns in the United Kingdom about General and Specific Applications of Genetic Engineering: Risk, Benefit, and Ethics conducted by Lynn J. Frewer, Chaya Howard and Richard Shepard investigates the terminology and reactions of respondents to different uses of genetic engineering. These uses vary from food related, agricultural and medical applications of genetic engineering. Once the respondents reacted to 15 different applications, results compared with a second study where fifteen more specific applications were used as stimuli. Finally the results were submitted to a Procrustes analysis which is a form of statistical analysis that is used to compare the results of surveys. It was revealed that application that concerned animals of human genetic material were viewed with concerns involving the ethical nature of the applications. The genetic modification of plants on the other hand were viewed as beneficiary and at times a necessity for the progress of humanity. The study aforementioned research relates to the research question by discussing the ethics behind genetic engineering and how the public views different applications related to the use of genetic engineering. The researchers clearly show expertise in the areas concerning genetic engineering. Lynn J. Frewer is a professor at Newcastle University located in England. She has held positions such as head of IFR and has her research in topics such as the effects of genetic in agriculture. Chaya Howard who also participated in this research, graduated from the University of Reading and followed up to become a research scientist at the university for more than 10 years.

The research paper The Perfect Storm - Genetic Engineering, Science and Ethic by Bernard E. Rollin discusses the role of ethics in the field of genetic engineering.Throughout the paper, the author illustrates how uncertainty and conflicting ethics has been a major factor in the societal rejection of the modification of genetic materials in humans and other species of animals. Rollin describes the six factors that contributed to make what he calls prefect concerning ethics and biotechnology. This perfect storm is what he considers the main factors of societal rejection of genetic engineering. The first he describes is the social demand of ethical discussion on the topic. The second is the poor scientific literacy of the general public concerning genetic engineering. The factors include poor social understanding of ethics; a Law for Scientific Ideology; vested interests dominating ethical discussion. The author concludes the paper by discussing his beliefs on how to break the vicious cycle of ignorance on the topic of genetic engineering. His proposal is a significant educational thrust; by educating the public and eliminating false stigma, the general public will see the benefits and potential risks of genetic engineering. The research paper relates to the discussion of ethics in genetic engineering by discussing how such ethical discussion have impacted the progress of the field. It discusses not only how society perception of genetic engineering ha been warped but he also provides a solution to educate the general public. The author is credible due to his rigorous background in academics and research.
