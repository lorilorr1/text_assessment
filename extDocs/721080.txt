Strange weather patterns, powerful storms, warming climate and melting snow caps are among the more visible signs that this consensus has validation. Over 90% of scientists agree on this topic (Cook). Despite the mounting evidence however, organizations and think-tanks exist that attempt to decry this consensus, claiming that recorded data and studies do not accurately reflect the magnitude of climate change. These organizations often have a strong sway in government and policy making, and if left unchecked, can cause state representatives to vote and support deregulation policy. When the term or is used, it is referring specifically to the effect that greenhouse gases have on the environment. In his book about the basics of climate change, Joseph Romm, physicist and climate expert, explains that the most harmful of these greenhouse gases is , or carbon dioxide. This gas traps reradiated heat from the sun in the atmosphere and causes it to warm the planet (Romm 1). In a lot of ways, this system of heating has worked perfectly throughout human history, as it would be too cold to live on earth if heat constantly escaped. However, the amount of heating that the planet undergoes has changed drastically in the last two hundred years (Romm 2). During the century, Europe and the United States entered what is now known as the industrial revolution; immense advances in technology allowed these titans of the world to produce faster, more efficiently and with less labor (Klassen). Factories and steam ships were invented and utilized to create and distribute goods, more expeditiously than had ever been done before. This gave rise to the beginning of commerce and trade as we see it today, manufacturing and sale in a scale the likes of which make the industrial revolution seem conservative. With the population of the world several times the amount that it was back in the 1800s, it is expected that demand would increase alongside it, and with it, production. Scientists have calculated that the levels in the atmosphere during the dawn of the industrial era two hundred years ago were about 280 parts per million. Today, scientists record 400 parts per million of , showing a 143% increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This is directly responsible for the heating up of the planet, which is now warmer than it was in 1900; of the warming happened from 1970 (Romm 2). Decade by decade, the record for warmest year on the earth has been topped; 1998 was succeeded by 2005, which was topped by 2010, which has already been replaced with 2014 (Romm 3). Pemberton 2 To combat this dilemma of rising temperatures, the United Nations created a body specifically to deal with climate change, known as the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change, or IPCC. In 2007, this group of the top scientists and climate researchers released an assessment on the state of the climate, concluding that global warming unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global average sea The one hundred and ninety-three countries who are members of the UN read and agreed with the scientific consensus (Romm 2). This signified a new period of regulations and commitments to ensure that the earth that we all shared was to be protected; each one of us played a part. However, despite growing trends of solidarity, some still differed. In the first decade of the century, amidst all the talk of reversing climate change and organizations and groups and think-tanks existed (and still do) that refuted the claims of the many consensuses. They were proponents of the belief that either the entire idea of climate change was a hoax, or that while the records and data were true, they did not dictate any threat to human ability to live and thrive on this planet. A lot of these organizations believed that not only was there a false narrative by the majority of the scientific community, but that their message and support was detrimental to financial growth. This idea stems from the fact that many supporters of climate change believe that deregulation of certain industries is the best way to decrease and other greenhouse gas emissions. If companies are given a cap on how much greenhouses gases they can emit, production will invariably decrease, resulting in less profit. The believe that One of the more notable groups amongst these opponents of global warming is known as The Heartland Institute. The Chicago Pemberton 3 Works Cited Romm, Joseph.
