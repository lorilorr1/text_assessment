Carlos Leon Ms. Collins ENC 1102-018 April 16, 2017 For Our Homeland We all come from the same place- Earth. A watery rock floating through space hosting a vast collection of fragile life. Life, that by all accounts, exists due to the excellent conditions of Earth. Consider humans particularly, if the planet gets too hot, too cold, too radiated, too much water, too little water etc. we humans would die of. Not mentioning our own limitations, short lifespan, weak bodies, constantly needing food etc., humans are quite frankly surviving with everything stacked against them. Which is why it boggles the mind that these same weak humans are trying so hard to change the very balance that keeps them alive. As it stands we humans, in our constant global industrial expansion, have begun to dramatically destroy the environment that barely supports us. This phenonium is called climate change- the changes in temperature, precipitation, or wind patterns, among other effects, that occur over several decades or (EPA). Moreover, after a decade of new agreeing evidence we have begun to somehow regress. Recently, climate change has been reduced to a political talking point; making public opinion regarding climate change [has increasingly C. Education, Politics and opinion about climate change evidence for interaction effects). But for now, consider just climate change as what it is- a phenonium. Climate change is quite simply any abnormal large change in climate over a long period of time. These large changes in climate are normal on Earth. The Earth undergoes a natural warming and cooling cycle this the well-established theory of climatic changes due to the variable solar (W. Schewarzacher, Milankovitch Cycles and the measurements of time). The problem is that the current climate data lies completely outside what would be a normal climate on Earth right now. Currently we are almost one degree Celsius over average global temperature (NASA Climate). While it might not seem like much, keep in mind that temperature has been constantly rising since the 50s unlike its normal up and down pattern that has sustained itself for centuries before that (NASA Climate). However, most people are better acquainted with the steep rise in CO2. Firstly, CO2 is important when considering climate change because it is a root cause. CO2 is a greenhouse gas- of the gases whose absorption of solar radiation is responsible for the greenhouse (Dictionary.com)- and the greenhouse effect are the reason the earth can stay warm when compared to its neighboring planets. These gases trap in solar radiation, by reflecting it back to land from the atmosphere. Because of this, the amount of CO2 can greatly affect how much reflection we get. Right now, we have so much CO2 that the global average temperature has risen as described above. The current CO2 readings how we have 405.6 parts per million (NASA Climate). Keep in mind that the CO2 had been relatively flat line at about 280 parts per million up until the 1800s (Solomon, Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis). It is no surprise that humans started the industrial revolution around this same time- the beginning of burning fossil fuels that produced CO2. The comparison between the past and the present show a scary increase. An increase that 97% of all currently active publishing climate scientist agree is led by humans (NASA Climate). As humans expended technologically during the industrial revolution a powerful source of fuel was needed. Solar, wind, geothermal, electric, hydroelectric, and biofuel had not been invented nor discovered, as such fossil duels were the only obvious choice to lead the industrial revolution. As such, it is not strange that CO2 rose in direct proportions to the expanse of the industrial revolution. Moreover, this very revolution is what ultimately lead to the discovery of alternative forms of energy and the tools used to study the climate today. Yet humans, knowing the problem and cause, have chosen to keep burning fossil fuels as part of daily life. Of course, it is natural to be detached form this issue. 405.6 is just a number and the scope of the issue encompasses all humans. And some might even go as far to say that the increase in CO2 is good because it creates more food for plants. However, consider instead not climate change itself but what it can do. As global temperatures increase the ice in the north and south poles begins to melt; right now, it is at about a rate of 3.4mm per year (NASA Climate). Leaving aside the destroyed animal habitats for polar bears and penguins, the ocean gets a little bit bigger and a bit warmer every time an iceberg melts. Putting aside the danger this means to flat, sea-level places like for example Florida, the rise in heat and warmer oceans can create something a much more tangible problem- a hurricane. In the approaching decades, we will start to see the averaged intensity of tropical cyclones to shift towards stronger storms, with intensity (Thomas R. Knutson, Tropical Cyclones and Climate Change). Here in Florida, the notion that more Katrina like hurricanes could make an appearance is a serious notion. Here in Tampa so close to the coast, a Katrina like hurricanes is an extremely serious notion. City-wide floods, power outages, destroyed homes and business, carved up roads, and causalities are far more tangible than a one degree Celsius increase in global temperature. On the other hand, someone who lives far more inland might still shrug their shoulders at the idea of more hurricanes. However, they are no safer than people on the coast. Weather patterns are changing globally. In places were droughts are common like the Southwest U.S, there will be more frequent and intense droughts (NASA Climate). The agricultural economy of the South will see a decline in upcoming years in soil moisture and crop yield due to the droughts. On the other hand, places were rainstorms are common like the Northern U.S. will see changes in precipitation patterns. The distribution of rain will center more around spring and winter months along with a general rise in precipitation. (NASA Climate). Yet perhaps some people will towards their modern house and wealth, and see security. To these people, it would behoove them to acknowledge the economic impacts of the effects of climate change. While the damages from hurricanes and rain, as well as the decreased production output of the agricultural sector in the U.S. is obvious they produced the least costly damages. The real threat lies simply in rising ocean level. Consider that most of the biggest cities in the world lie on the coast line. Consider that most of the money exchange in the world happens in cities. Consider what will happens when high tide reaches downtown Tampa. When the streets, sidewalks, old buildings, and new buildings begin to erode who will pay for it? Everyone will. Moreover, any occasion when the tide gets so high work needs to pause, money will be lost. In response to this some have propose setting up a wall to stop the tide, but this is temporary solution that will in all cases ultimately fail and must be costly. For any solution to work effectively against climate change cooperation is needed. We need to stop putting so much CO2 in the atmosphere and stop destroying the trees and forests which take CO2 out of the atmosphere. This will mean putting in policies and laws preventing deforestation, or at the least demand more trees be planted for every one that was cut down. This will mean making gasoline/diesel cars more expensive and subsidizing electric cars to make them less expensive. This will mean funding colleges and research institutes to create practical alternate energy sources. But, for any of these ideas to happen, we need to convince the people who put in policies to do so. We need to contact our legislators, our representatives, our congressmen and tell them that we, as a society, want to keep the planet livable for humans. We need to convince the current administration not disregard climate change as hoax or fake news, but instead work together with other countries in order to secure a planet for all of us. It might very well be hard to change the mind of the people in power, but remember that this is a republic. If the people in power do not work for us, they do not work at all. And lastly, remember to help the people who fight for us when we cannot. The National Resource Defense Council and other grassroot groups are out there advocating in the name of people and need help to keep fighting the good fight. This is not about destroying corporations or hurting the economy, this is about staying alive as a species. Work Cited Schwarzacher, W. Milankovitch cycles and the measurement of  Terra Nova.
