Cruz !1 Zachary Cruz Kristen Rouisse ENC1102 29 January 2017 Healthcare for Undocumented Immigrants The current issue with undocumented immigrants is what we do with them. There were around 11.3 undocumented immigrants and 2014 but we sure how much they make up today. One of my stakeholders, the Trump cabinet, wants to deport 11.3 million and ban anyone who is tied to the religion of Islam. The Trump cabinet believes in alt-right wing politics so their views on immigration are very destructive. The trump cabinet believes in banning all or most of illegal immigrants because there is a myth that they are all criminals and rapists. His deportation force would force people to leave the country and it would get rid of a good amount of criminals. But it still would tear apart families that contribute to society as much as allowed to. And my other stakeholder is Grameen Vida Sana which is a benefit program that gives undocumented immigrants healthcare. This benefit program was created for the sole purpose to help undocumented immigrants so that they can have basic affordable healthcare which is similar to the Affordable Care Act/ Obamacare. To people like me this kind of program feels like the first step into having a pathway to citizenship. But it could mean actual criminals receiving affordable healthcare or possibly even getting citizenship in the far future. These two stakeholders both have very different views, one wants to give affordable healthcare one wants to deport the person that was accepting that healthcare. These two stakeholders are at odds and probably come to a conclusion because of how different their views are, if Trump only Cruz !2 deports criminals and allows the rest of the undocumented immigrants to get Grameen Vida healthcare and a pathway to citizenship (since they are not a threat to the country) then that would mean a great compromise between these two very different stakeholders. The Trump cabinets views on immigration are very strict for example one of his Point Plans to Put America is working on an impenetrable wall on the southern border, on day one. Mexico will pay for the (Immigration) In regards to his views on illegal immigrants it seems he make up his mind. On his website it says criminal aliens out day one, in joint operations with local, state, and federal law enforcement. We will terminate the Obama deadly, non-enforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam our (Immigration) in regards to only illegal immigrants. But in reference to all illegal immigrants will go out. They will come back..They have to come back (Rep. Bass) but again his plan to deport also on to include people who have charged with any criminal offense or who committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal (Planas) Basically he truly just wants to deport some of them and have them go through the visa process. This is good for finally enforcing our law but if you think of the inhumanity of rounding up 2 or 3 million people and sending them back on boats to their countries sounds pretty horrible. Him and his plans have a positive and negative effect on our country and also have very different view of immigrants than the Grameen Vida Sana benefit program. Which seems to has one goal aim to ameliorate the link between poverty and poor health by increasing access to care, preventive services and health education, while decreasing out-of-pocket costs, ER visits and lost (No) This goal is basically a Cruz !3 representation of the affordable care act. Grameen America created Grameen Vida Sana for undocumented immigrants which a $45/month benefit program that includes an affordable that includes primary care, personal health coaches, weekly group wellness meetings, educational materials, and access to health (Nonprofit Organizations) This will definitely help them because they might not be able to get care because of the lifestyle they are forced to live in because they citizens. Also if it for undocumented immigrants there have been a of $35.1 billion to the Medicare Trust Fund between 2000 and 2011, according to a new Journal of General Internal Medicine study recently (No) So undocumented immigrants a burden on the healthcare system either if someone tried to argue that. Giving them access to affordable healthcare could be a great start towards a pathway to citizenship and Grameen PrimaCare would be in fave of that but Trumps organization agree. So sadly since Trump is president the decision of a compromise would have to be given to him. But actually Trump might be in favor of that because on Huffington Post it says deportation would happen to who have charged with any criminal or who acts that constitute a chargeable criminal (Rep. Bass) So in regards to that Trump would be okay with this compromise. Trumps goal is to get his deportation force to criminal aliens out day but he really say much about the other immigrants. Although Grameen goal is to have healthcare affordable for everyone. So Trump would have to give up on his hope of deporting all illegal immigrants and stick to his original goal on his website and focus only on the criminals. Grameen Primacare would have to give up on helping the criminals get healthcare. But the compromise would consist of Trump creating his Cruz !4 deportation force to deport only the undocumented immigrants that are an actual threat and allow Grameen Primacare to help illegal immigrants receive healthcare. So in conclusion even though the Trump organization and Grameen America/Primacare have different views it is possible to find a compromise. The Trump organization believed in deposing all or most of the undocumented immigrants but Grameen America/Primacare believes affordable healthcare to all even undocumented immigrants. These different views are able to ignore the odds between them and work together. The compromise to only deport criminals and allow the ones that are still here to receive healthcare and possible citizenship seems like a great compromise.
