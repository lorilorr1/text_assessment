Sebastian Coladonato 29/1/2017 Enc1102 Smartphone stakeholders The topic I am researching is how cell phones are dumbing down our society, instilling more of an idiocrasy. Two major companies who are involved in this revolution are apple and android. These are the two major smart phone providers. Even though these companies both produce smartphones and both try to get as many customers they have two completely products with 2 completely different objectives for the products. The differences and similarities that these companies have provide benefits but also complications for these companies and their selling points. Apple is an international cooperation that makes total revenue of $46.9 billion and quarterly net income of $9 (Ashleigh Macro, Macworld). Apple prides themselves in being different from everyone else, which is why their slogan is think different. Apple is also so proud in how good their product is that they made their products closed systems meaning software system where the carrier or service provider has control over applications, content, and media, and restricts convenient access to non-approved applications or (Wikipedia, page 1) this means that you cannot change anything that they produce, that their products are what they are and come how they come. Apple also likes to keep everything simple and easy, allowing the users to understand everything easier which over all makes their product less intimidating to the users and more users friendly. Over the years, apple has changed from this complex company to a house hold name, which is what makes them such a stakeholder in this debate. Android is the other major stake holder involved in this debate. Android is also an international cooperation with hitting $18.1 (ANDREW MARTONIK, Google posts earnings: $66 billion revenue for 2014, $18 billion in Q4 alone). Androids pride is with their purpose, which is to make the best product and have help from everyone to do so, which is why there slogan is better together not the same. Android is different than apple with the fact that it is an open system, is system in which the components and protocols conform to standards independent of a particular (google.com) that means that the phone is legally customizable, you are allowed to change anything on the phone, for example, you can rout it, hack it, upgrade it, put an apple os on it, do anything and you allowed to do so. Android produces a more complicated phone; they do not try to make it easier to access. So they lose younger aged consumers and gain older aged people, most people go towards androids at older ages. Most people who get androids are those who are interested in that kind of technology interested in hacking and making technology on their own. Android allows the user to change any aspect of the phone to do whatever they wish, you can even tell them and if they like it they will change their overall product and produce the better version that you created. Androids interaction with its users is what makes it the other huge stake holder. Even though these stake holders are so different they do have some stuff in common. Both of these produce the best smart phones in the business without any competition from the other competitors. These companies also produce similar products though. They both try and produce a product that will capture the attention, but is also easily beatable so that they can continue producing more and more phones that are so called new and come out with a great margin of revenue. They have the same new features too, it is as if they plan it, always who can go slimmer, who can have a bigger screen, who can have a bigger camera, who can have better speakers, whose screen can have better quality, who has better battery life, and what phone has better performance. what they do over and over every single time they put out a new phone. Apple says 7 dramatically improves the most important aspects of the iPhone experience. It introduces advanced new camera systems. The best performance and battery life ever in an iPhone. Immersive stereo speakers. The brightest, most colorful iPhone display. Splash and water resistance.1 and it looks every bit as powerful as it is. This is iPhone (apple). Androids new phone, the Samsung galaxy note 5 is said to have 5.7-inch screen gives you ample room to doodle with the S Pen, and while certainly bigger in the hand than the Galaxy S7, its curved back makes it easy enough to hold if you have a large grasp. I also got better use of split-screen multitasking and the camera on this beast of a (Matt Swider, galaxy note 5 review). These two companies also have a lot of differences. One of the major one is the open and closed system. Apple is a closed system, every single product the put out is a closed system ,no acception, so far this works out extremely well but see about the future. And android is an open system, as I said it is when you can do whatever you want to the phone and android accepts it and implores it. we know, iOS is an entirely closed system: you can only get (in the absence of jailbreaking your phone) apps that come from Apps Store. Android is much more open: there are multiple sources and you can load your phone down with software from anywhere you Tim Worstall , The Problem With Closed Apps Universe). But there are more differences. With new apple phones they took out the headphone jack, this forces users to convert to the Bluetooth option, it seemed like a good idea but it really work to well. Consumers saw this as just another reason to switch to android. Apple and android are both great companies in my mind but they are still very intense competitors in the technological smart phone race to dumb people down. They have commonalities, and differences but the most important thing is that they respect each other and have a heathy competition. 333333333q3 e3 33 3 3 3 3 3 3 33333333 3 3 3 3 3 333 3 3 3 33 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 333 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 33 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 32 Work cited Worstall, Tim.
