This fact implies one very important aspect of those markets, which is what goods and services are being produced and sold. As one of main concepts states, consumers are the ones who determine which goods and services firms produce or sell because being competitive and trying to satisfy potential buyers is the only way for a company to survive.

The goal of this research is to identify what specific emotions and feelings influence willingness to buy certain products or use various services provided by business companies.

Dhaoui finds a connection between partial dysfunction of the economics in explaining inconsistent return and trading volume behavior in major international stock markets to human psychology. Author makes an attempt to expose why the hypothesis of absolute rationality of behavior fails to explain variability of returns and trading volume by the fact that in previous decades of this theory did not take in their Sharipbayev 2 consideration human biases, beliefs and feelings. The investigation of these issues was based on daily data of five international Stock Markets in Japan, U.S., France, U.K. and Switzerland over the period from June 10, 2002 to November 17, 2011. Results of study show that people be fully rational in making decisions of how big trades should they make or if they should at all because there are several types of psychological behavior involved such as and As seen from the research, mostly investors base their decisions on outcomes of those acting non- rationally first, but even after these observations and looking at benefits or losses of their previous trades they tend to act overconfidently or too pessimistically. Thus, these decisions drive the economy and significantly influence the trading volume of major stock markets. This article perfectly fits in my topic because it clearly explains the aspects of emotions and feelings and their presence in the decision-making process in the field of investments.

Kim et al. also reveal other interesting findings. For example, some so said like pride or have negative effect on brand attitude because people visiting luxury stores with purchasing motive do so in order to feel more privileged.

Wolter et al. examine human tendencies in self-identification with brands and their products. Many business companies use a strategy of creating a certain image of their product, which is satiated with trough the means of advertisement. As mentioned in the research, an example of it would be a TV commercial of Dos beer producer, in which qualities of most interesting man in the were prescribed to a beer. As a result of this campaign, their more than and brand has outpaced the growth rate of the top ten import There also was Sharipbayev 3 a survey conducted and its results revealed that about 28% of beer consumers confirmed that they experience self-definition with the product. The half of consumers were themselves with a certain brand of beer and another half were or in other words, were strongly against those presented by this brand. Authors illustrate that many consumers are constantly trying to find fulfillment of their personal values in the products they buy. Moreover, the fact that people can have negative attitude towards certain goods and their qualities only strengthens the argument that people are easily inclined towards believing in the of brands. Thus, consumers are prone to experience similar feelings towards them as they may have feelings towards a real individual in some aspects. Honea, H. (2005). Investigating the impact of negative self-conscious emotions on consumer memory, processing, and purchase. Advances in Consumer Research, 32(1), 189-192.
