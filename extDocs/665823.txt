McKeighan 1 Kevin McKeighan Madeline Gottlieb ENC1102 1 March 2017 The Federal Stance on Immigration The field of agriculture is arguably one of the most essential components to economy, which has led to an increase of employees who lack immigration status. Roughly half the number of agricultural jobs in the USA are fulfilled by illegal immigrants currently residing in this country (Zahniser 2017). This caused the Federal Government to take action in order to reform the current policies in order to account for the growing population. Image A, which pictures a group of shadow figures standing together before the American flag, represents the unity of people in this country, especially when it comes to immigration. The approach of image B is to strike the emotional side of the audience that image A might have neglected. It portrays a family of Hispanic-Americans who are holding up signs, one of which says families People are typically moved more when they can make an emotional connection to something such as image B which is why it is such an effective approach. Though both images touch on the impact of immigration reforms, they take different approaches to convey the message. Image A takes a more motivational approach whereas image B strikes an emotional approach in the audience. Image A can be dissected into many different aspects, such as color schemes, subliminal messages etc. One of the first things the audience may notice is the brick wall that the American Flag is painted over. To speculate, it could be said that the brick wall represents the sturdiness, structure and fortification of our country. One can argue that the brick wall subliminally implies that the foundation of this country is immigration. Another aspect is the size of the wall and how McKeighan 2 it seems to be smaller than the people standing before it. The way the shadows are casted up on the wall makes it seem like the people are some distance from the wall, which in turn tells the viewers that they are sizably bigger than the wall itself. This means that the people in this picture are bigger than the Federal Government and that when people stand up for a common cause, they can achieve anything. The unity of any group or organization, when motivated by something as monumental as immigration reforms, can be a very powerful thing. The last observation made about image A was how the illustrator decided to picture shadow people instead of personalizing them and identifying these individuals. This can be taken to represent the equality of all the people in this picture, as there are people of all different shapes and sizes. When it comes to conveying subliminal messages, rhetorical strategies are some of the most effective ways to break down images. Image A depicts clear signs of ethos and kairos strategies whereas image B has more characteristics of pathos and logos strategies. One example of ethos in image A is how all the shadow figures stand united in front of the American flag. This represents the character of people who are fighting for immigration reform to benefit all parties involved. Kairos also pertains to this image as immigration is a viral topic in political discussion. It is most certainly something on mind with the new change in presidency which is why the image pertains to the kairos strategy. Equality is an ongoing battle in this nation and it is because of this that one can speculate the person who made this image wanted the viewers to feel united and equal to their peers. Image B, on the other hand, takes a completely different approach when it comes to advocating reformation to the immigration policies of the United States. When the audience sees this image, often their first reaction was sadness and empathy for the family who are protesting the reforms. Image B portrays more aspects of pathos and logos as it sends a strong message McKeighan 3 through emotion. Signs of pathos can be seen in the expressions. Their sign calls the viewers to action, they do this so that they are able to grab the attention, bringing more awareness to the topic. The image also strikes the logos strategy because of the message it sends; which is that when people stand up and stand together, anything is possible. The overwhelming sense of unity in this image sends a strong message and it is because of this that logos can be easily identified. One of the aspects of this image that makes it so powerful is the presence of a mother, a father and a child who is most likely too young to fully understand the gravity of the situation. It can be inferred that the mother and father represent the hard working, lower class immigrants in this country, who have worked their whole lives to build a better future for their kids. Unfortunately, there are situations where certain family members, who were smuggled into this country, lack the immigration status needed to reside in this country. This results in a moral conflict of whether to break the family apart or send the entire family back to their native country. With that being said, the little boy in the image can represent the innocence of those affected by this dilemma and to also convey the message that even though their family member(s) may not be legal citizens, that they are a productive member of society. Finally, the most poignant characteristic of this image is the sign that reads families It is without a doubt the center of attention in this picture and it is responsible for the emotional nature of the context. The emotions brought on by the sign, when placed right next to the child wearing a Mexico shirt is the driving force behind the emotional appeal to this image. When it comes to immigration policies in the USA, it is clear that the Federal Government intends to take action. The dilemma comes when the government must decide which reformations to make in order to abide by the constitution and also fulfill the moral values of all Americans. It can be immensely difficult to find a common ground between these two McKeighan 4 binaries, but the images presented give an accurate representation of both sides. It is important that the Federal Government consider everyone who will be affected by change in the policy and that they act accordingly.
