Edwards 1 Krystal Edwards Professor Kristen Rouisse ENC 1102. 093 April 16 th , 2017 Depletion of Freshwater Sources It comes as no surprise that people use water every day. They use it for almost everything they do and it can be found in almost anything an individual eats or drinks. Water is a vital resource in society today and was since the beginning of time. However, what if the supply of water ran out today? Or tomorrow? What would anyone do? Unfortunately this has been happening in numerous amounts of countries all around the world. countries face extremely high levels of water stress meaning that more than 80 percent of the water available to agricultural, domestic, and industrial users is withdrawn businesses, farms, and communities vulnerable to (World Resources Institute).Due to the fact that the number of countries that are facing water stress is growing rapidly, that just shows that this is a global problem that needs to be addressed immediately. Thus, because of the rapid decline of freshwater on Earth, people who tend to use more water than necessary should be more conservative with the use of freshwater and also donate to organizations like Horizon International Solutions that help people that do not have it to ensure that freshwater is left here on Earth for everyone to use. Water covers 70 percent of the surface and out of that 70 percent, 97 percent is salt water and only 1 percent is fresh water. Now of that 1 percent of freshwater, 70 percent of that goes into irrigation and 22 percent goes into numerous industries while only 8 percent is Edwards 2 used for domestic use (Rusnak). From this breakdown, it comes as no surprise that freshwater is already limited but most people are not aware of this. This is why people should limit their water consumption while they are doing various activities such as brushing their teeth, showering, washing dishes and other things that may need the use of a lot of water. Many local governments now have laws that specify that water faucets, toilets, and showers only allow a certain amount of water flow per minute so that there can be some conservation of water (United States Geological Survey). According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the average person uses 80-100 gallons of water per day. This means that in an average week, a person that lives in the United States is using 560-700 gallons of water. If the United States population is roughly at 326,474,013, this means that over 26 billion gallons of water is being used per day. Of course this is a lot of water but the scary part is that this is only the consumption of one country. It might come as a surprise but one in eight people on the planet do not have access to clean water and yet the depletion of fresh water is at risk. There needs to be more of a proper management on how people use and consume water and how there can be access to people who have any. Although the depletion of freshwater may not seem to affect people in developed countries such as the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, etc. this problem can affect them tremendously because water is a resource that everyone on Earth uses. The people in these countries need to imagine themselves in others shoes and think about how it would be if water at their fingertips every time they needed it and how it would be if they had to go miles just to get some to sustain both themselves and their families. Failing to actively confront this problem would be that freshwater is not viable anymore thus; it would make it much harder for people to get. According to the Nature Conservancy if action is not taken towards fixing our Edwards 3 fresh water ecosystems, within about 10 years most people on the planet will face life with water shortages. Now half of the major rivers are being seriously polluted and/or depleted (Natural Conservancy).It might be hard for people in developed countries to imagine having such a reliable resource gone but it is definitely possible especially since fresh water is low in reserves in the first place. Although people are doing some damage when it comes to the depletion of freshwater, agriculture also plays a major role in this problem as well. It is estimated that, farms use up to 2,000 to 10,000 gallons per day depending on the size, and this is just in the United States alone (Penn State Extension). This is a huge number especially since there are farms located all around the world. On farms water is not only used for crops but they are also used for things such as feeding the animals, bathing them, using it on miscellaneous equipment and etc. Although most farms now incorporate an irrigation system where there is a controlled amount of water used for their agricultural crops especially when rainfall is absent, there still needs to be a way where farms can still use less amount of water a day. Due to the fact that more and more people are finding out about this problem, there have been numerous attempts in trying to find ways to possibly get less water to go a longer way. There are plenty of organizations out there that are coming up with solutions every day to fight this problem and have water available for everyone everywhere. Organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and Horizon International Solutions (HIS) helps this cause on two levels. The first level would be that they try to find a solution that would benefit the Earth, this means that they try to see how they can get back rivers and other sources that have been depleted. The second level would be that they help people across the globe that does not have easy access to freshwater to get access. This means that they build wells and become Edwards 4 innovative with helping people. As long as organizations like these are tackling the problem from both ends in the future people ever have to worry about how they are going to get water. In conclusion, although there may seem like there is plenty of water to go around and that there might not be an end to it people should still be wary that there are some people on this Earth that even get water every day. People should donate to organizations like the World Health Organization or Horizon International Solutions so that fresh water can remain here on Earth and so that everyone can access it just as easily as people in developed countries do. Even if one want to donate, small appreciate physical help as well as long as a person is willing. Everyone wants to ensure a safe future for themselves and for their children and accessing freshwater have to be a hassle for anyone at all because it is something provided here on Earth.
