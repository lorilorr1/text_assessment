Carver1 Matt Carver James Josue ENC1102 28 January 2017 Capital Punishment in the USA Capital punishment, otherwise known as the death penalty, is a government practice where a person is put to death as a punishment for a crime. Although the crimes that receive this punishment vary between the states, the federal government applies the death penalty to crimes involving: treason, terrorism, espionage, federal murder, and large-scale drug trafficking. Justice For All (JFA) and National Coalition Against the Death Penalty (NCADP) are two organizations at odds with each other due to their vastly different views on the worth of the death penalty. JFA embraces the death penalty for its effect on crime deterrence, constitutionality, and ethical purpose; meanwhile NCADP pushes for the end of the death penalty due to its immorality, cost and safety. Qualities both stakeholders share are desires to enforce an ethical punishment, a cheaper financial solution, and an outcome that deters crime to ensure public safety in the USA. The JFA organization is an avid believer that the strongest crime deterrence available is the death penalty. As a result it is worth any risk or cost, because it keeps crime rates, especially violent crime, lower. Support for the death penalty in America is 63% with 31 states practicing it while only 19 states abolished it. The majority of the support is enough to rank America at 5 th in the world in leading number of executions by the death penalty (Gallup 2014). Contrary to popular belief, the majority of Catholics and Protestants approve of the death penalty and Carver2 insist it is ethical. On the other hand, people with no religious backgrounds tend to have a stronger demand for the end of the death penalty. JFA believes executions of the people who qualified for the death penalty are approved ethically simple because they deserved it for what they did, whether it is murder, treason, etc. Although abolitionists of the death penalty argue that the capital punishment system is unjust and racially discriminating, there is no substantial evidence to prove it. Since 1973, 157 people put on death row have been proven innocent (DPIC 2017). Moreover, JFA states that the overall deterrence effect is worth the few small mistakes in the system and lost lives, due to the overall safer environment it will bring to the larger population. In other words, the risk of executing a few innocent people is worth it for the greater good of the safety. NCADP calls for the abolition of the death penalty due to its cost, immorality, racial bias and in order to save innocent victims from being executed. The cost of an inmate on death row is up to 10 times more expensive than an inmate on a life sentence with no parole. This is due to various factors such as a much more complex and lengthier process filled with more appeals and retrials and extremely increased pricing in death row prisoner housing. Housing costs have tripled since 1998 and the lengthy processes take several months, racking up large legal bills for the state (Newton 2016). NCADP believes that killing people is immoral and even the worst criminals and murderers should not be put to death. The organization believes the deterrence of a life sentence with no parole is just as strong as the death penalty which can be seen as an easy way out for some criminals. A life sentence with no parole forces an inmate to live out the rest of their life behind bars with no chance at all of ever leaving. Racial bias in the death penalty is observed from a study showing murderers who killed a white man were given the death sentence 2.5 times more than murderers who killed a black or Hispanic man. The gap broadens even more Carver3 so when a white female is the victim; those murderers are given death sentences 5 times more (NCADP 2016). Inmates that are on death row realize they will be put to death eventually, so they often act out more often and are more dangerous than the average inmate. As a result, prison guards and other workers are attacked and injured, put in way by death row (Daems 2011). All of these factors add to the push for a nationwide and then worldwide abolition of capital punishment. A common middle ground is attainable between NCADP and JFA, because they both desire crime deterrence for public safety, lower costs, and an ethical and just process. A possible compromise is to abandon death penalty executions and transition to a life sentence with no parole charge. Polls show that more people fear a slow timely death from life imprisonment and prefer being put to death. Furthermore, this supports the idea that crime deterrence will be just as strong if not stronger without the death penalty (Gallup 2014). The pros of this compromise include prices up to 10 times cheaper than the death penalty, more safety to prison guards and workers, no easy way out like executions provide and it still deters crime effectively (Radelet 2016). On the other hand, the cons of this solution are indicted innocent citizens will have less opurtunities to appeal and get out of their life long charge. Also even if all the claims of racial bias were abolished with the death penalty, there is no way to determine if life sentences will be given with any more equality to different races and ethnicities. Working on creating a more justifiable and equal justice system with no bias will always be a goal, but unfortunately there is no clear evidence or ways to measure it and prove bias is around due to the multiple factors at hand. Modern technology and forensics has improved exponentially in the last decade so in most cases there innocent victims given death or life sentences. In the rare circumstance that Carver4 they do occur, the justice system must be able to correct these errors and cite more conclusive results, so no more innocent people spend their in jail.
