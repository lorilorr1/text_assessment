Singer 1 Molly Singer Professor Davis ENC 1102 16 April 2017 Turning Tides: A New SeaWorld When people hear the name Shamu, they usually think of the infamous killer whale of the same name in an aquatic theme park called SeaWorld. Fifty years in the making, SeaWorld has cultivated a brand for itself, leading the way in aquatic mammal care and educating the public on these animals. However, for most of the existence, the public has generally been supportive of SeaWorld, its foundation was shaken when a documentary called Blackfish came out at a film festival in 2013. The film depicted SeaWorld and a few other earlier marine parks as places that heinously mistreated the marine mammals held in their parks. Whether the facts presented in the documentary were true or not, many people did not view SeaWorld in a positive light after seeing the film. Because of it, countless people and organizations have called for SeaWorld to make changes to improve the lives of the animals they host. Bothered by the fact that people did not feel that SeaWorld truly cared for their animals, the parks began to make majors changes towards building both a better SeaWorld and a better world. SeaWorld is not only making changes internally with how their marine mammals live, but externally in communities worldwide by creating SeaWorld Cares, an umbrella of the company that covers many new programs to promote environmental and wildlife conservation. In its efforts to better itself, it is more important now than ever that SeaWorld has the help and support of the people, both to promote and spread word of all the good SeaWorld is now doing, and to join their efforts to protect our world by joining some of new teams. Singer 2 Since the Blackfish documentary mainly discusses the mistreatment of the killer whales living in parks, it is important that the future plans include improving the living standards for these animals. Plans such as these are already in the works; according to a post of the SeaWorld Cares website the parks have ended the breeding of its killer whales making this current generation its last. In addition, all-new orca experiences will soon take place in more natural looking habitats, and with a focus on the natural (A Vision For SeaWorld). This means that the new habitats being built to host the killer whales are going to better resemble their natural habitat versus just having a pool big enough to fit them in. Some may still complain about SeaWorld keeping these animals in captivity, but they need to consider the state these animals are used to living in. Because current generation of Orcas were bred and born into captivity, they know little to nothing about living in the wild and fending from themselves. Also, many of the whales are not in the physical condition to live in the wild, so changing the artificial habitat to something more suited to them is the best option in this situation. Coming along with these new living situations, the animals are going to be given a break from the performances they were forced to do, and the new will be focused more on promoting research, education, care and respect that align with our mission to advance the well-being and conservation of these beautiful (Educational Encounters). Similar to how the orca show had set times in the past, these new orca encounters will have specific time periods where guest may see the animals, ensuring that the whales still get time to themselves and will not be overwhelmed by visitors. In order to compensate for the loss of the theatrical shows, one of biggest attractions, the parks will gain new charms to attract guests. Included is a virtual reality rollercoaster and a documentary-style orca encounter to directly replace the theatrical shows. A San Diego Union-Tribune article discusses Singer 3 about how these new attractions the move to lure more visitors with cutting- edge theme park technology while still staying true to its mission of providing meaningful experiences that it hopes will educate and inspire people to take action on behalf of animals and the (A Whale of A Business). Tying everything back to the mission to educate and inspire is an important goal SeaWorld has now taken more notice of and hopefully will stay aligned with. While it may be clear as to why SeaWorld is changing things internally with how the parks treat their animals, many people may ask: why go beyond the parks? Why go out into world and do work? The answer is quite simple: it is part of mission. Since the parks first opened fifty years ago, wildlife and environmental conservation has been a part of goal in hosting their marine mammals to educate the public on the world around them, and the importance of protecting it. In the same fashion SeaWorld is reforming many aspects of the company within the parks; it is creating many new conservation and animal rescue programs and reforming old ones that follow mission. conservation and rescue efforts are comprised of several different teams completing diverse tasks, yet they all come together to strive towards the goal of sustaining animal wildlife and the environment. Thanks to the efforts of the SeaWorld Rescue and Animal Care teams, nearly 30,000 animals were given a second chance at life; but even then, they do not take all the credit. SeaWorld attributes much of the success of these teams to support of partner agencies, park guests, and people across the globe who take action to protect these amazing (Animal Rescue and Research at SeaWorld). Furthermore, another germane part of external efforts is its research program, which has been a part of the company from the beginning and set many of the standards used today in caring for marine mammals. Not only has the research Singer 4 program published 300 of its own scientific studies, but it contributes to other research projects, funds other projects around the world, and allows them to use the SeaWorld parks and animals as a dynamic research environment, letting researchers study the animals up close. SeaWorld updates the efforts of these rescue and research teams through a series of blog-like articles on seaworldcares.com; things such as important milestones and a rescue counter are kept up to date on the website. SeaWorld also has a 24/7 on call help line for animal emergencies globally. This feature greatly aids the rescue accomplishment of saving over 29,000 animals (On Call 24/7 To Help Animals). In addition to research and rescue, SeaWorld invests a lot of time in the conservation of the environment from ensuring that the parks use responsible food sourcing to providing guests with simple everyday conservation tips, there are various ways SeaWorld tries to keep the world clean and healthy while inspiring others to do so as well. SeaWorld has a few partnerships with other corporations that strive to protect the environments. One example of these partnerships is with Guy Harvey. This partnership aims to protect oceans, but more specifically it tries to protect sharks, whose numbers have been rapidly declining. While conducting research through shark tracking, the partnership hopes to educate the masses about the need for shark conservation. Although partnerships like these are significant in keeping things moving in a positive direction, SeaWorld truly needs the support of the public to be successful in reaching its goals. There are countless ways that people can get involved with what SeaWorld is trying to accomplish. Like the research and rescue teams mentioned earlier, there are teams that volunteers can join to help with some of those efforts. Originally SeaWorld had the Truth Team whose goal was to spread the truth about the things SeaWorld really was doing; spawned from that came the SeaWorld Action Team. This team is made up of members of the Truth Team, Singer 5 supporters, partners, animal trainers, and conservationists. The main duties for the action team are spreading, about the latest animal rescues or research and writing and encouraging action on species and habitat conservation and advocacy for zoos and (Introducing the SeaWorld Action Team). To get more young people involved, SeaWorld has also created the Youth Advisory Council, which is comprised of teens who deeply care for protecting the world around them. The council gives input on current conservation efforts in place and comes up with ideas with how to inspire other people their age to care as much as they do. If someone is looking for a simpler way to get involved with efforts, people can use its new myActions social network, a place that is updated with easy ways to make a difference. The social network additionally tracks a impact over time to actually show the difference they are making. Another great way to help out is to donate to conservation fund which provides resources for numerous conservation programs. Moreover, simply visiting a SeaWorld park and acknowledging all of the changes being made would be greatly appreciated by the company. Although the Blackfish documentary may have had a negative impact on reputation and financial stability, it ultimately helped the company to reflect on itself and all- around improve the quality of the work being done. Both internally and externally, SeaWorld has made sure that all its efforts are being driven by its fifty-year-old mission to educate, inspire and change the public to help animals and the environment. Now it is the turn to put in some effort to contribute to the success of conservation, and animal rescue and research. Even by doing something as simple as getting educated on the issues facing these areas is doing something profound.
