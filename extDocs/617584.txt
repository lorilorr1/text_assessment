Kellman 1 Abraham Kellman ENC 1102.003 Dennis January 29, 2017 Physician Assisted Suicide: Dignified death or Homicide? Brittany was a regular 29-year-old women; she had a home, a husband and a life until New 2014. After months of suffering from terrible headaches, Brittany went to a doctor and was diagnosed with brain cancer. She went through one surgery to remove her tumor, but it came back with a vengeance and the doctors gave her a prognosis of six months to live. She researched extensively options to treat this cancer, but the only options that came up had side effects that would drastically reduce the quality of her life. Brittany even looked into hospice care, where she could live out the rest of her days; but, due to her cancers severity, she could have pain that would be resistant to even the strongest pain medications. So the last resort she had was to uplift her whole life and move to Oregon, where physician assisted suicide (PAS) was legal and live out her days until her suffering became too great (Maynard, 1). Brittany is like many terminally ill people in America and across the world, however only 18 countries in the world have legalized physician assisted suicide (Wikipedia, 4). Due to the lack of access to this practice, organizations like Death with Dignity (DWD) were created. DWD believes that terminally ill people have the right to choose physician assisted suicide, because it minimizes suffering and expense. On the other hand, groups like Care not Killing, oppose physician assisted suicide due to the fact it infringes on rights and devalue human life. To satisfy the Kellman 2 objectives of both groups, physician assisted suicide (PAS) should be performed only by doctors licensed to do so, and the act itself should be put in the patients hands. According to the Education in Palliative and End-Of-Life Care for Oncology assisted suicide is defined as the act of a physician in providing the means for a patient to hasten his or her (6). This idea of legally killing oneself with the aid of a doctor or other qualified medical professional has led to a lot of controversy in the past two decades. The main argument against PAS is that good palliative or hospice care options are available and the stress of purposefully taking a life for a physician could be debilitating (Wilson, 317). However, just as there is opposition there is support for the legalization of PAS, and this is where charities and organizations like DWD come into notability. DWD is a national charity organization with a main goal of allowing the freedom of all eligible terminally ill patients to decide how and when they choose to die. It has a yearly budget of about $600,000 and, because it is a public charity, anybody in the USA can be a member (DWD). Keith Wilson, an associate professor and psychologist at the university of Ottawa, performed a study with terminally ill patients that had a prognosis of six months or less to live (uOttawa). The main purpose of this study was to determine whether one supports or opposes one or both PAS and euthanasia, and for what reasons. There were a total of 379 participants and about 62.8% of them believed that one or both of them should be legalized. However, 26.1% firmly believed that neither of them should be legalized (Wilson, 316). Although this was the minority in this study, the percentage of people who opposed the legalization, even though they were the same position as the other majority of the participants, was quite large. In order to give a voice to this small minority and its supporters, organizations like Care not Killing were created. This organizations goals are to protect the doctors who do not believe in PAS, promote and Kellman 3 better palliative care over PAS or euthanasia at all, and to ensure that the lives of the people who are really being considered at their full value. This organization brings together disability and human rights groups, health organizations and religious groups from around the world (Care not Killing). These organizations are at complete odds on this very controversial topic, and in order to reach a sort of middle ground a compromise must be proposed. The main objective for this compromise is to attempt to satisfy some of each of the stakeholders main goals. Firstly, the act of physician assisted suicide must be legalized and allowed, however restrictions for who are allowed to perform and participate in the act would be enacted. Doctors who support and would like to be a part of the process must go through a vigorous ethics course especially designed for PAS and be tested upon conclusion, all in hopes of receiving a license that would allow them to actually prescribe the drug. Then the people who are considered eligible for this prescription must be legal, terminally ill with six months or less to live, and able to administer the drug. Lastly, only if the person decides to actually perform the act they must go to a licensed location turn in the prescription and take the drug within a private and locked location.
