Lee 1 Yejin Lee Kristen Rouisse ENC1102 14 April 2017 Legalization of Marijuana in the United States The federal government has prohibited either recreational or medical use of marijuana through the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). However, since 1996 in which California first legalized the medical use of marijuana, 29 states, the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico have legalized either medical use or recreational use of marijuana Medical Marijuana Laws Furthermore, the public support towards the legalization of marijuana has been increasing since 1970s. According to the General Social Survey, public support has steadily increased to 57% in 2016 compared to the 43% in 2012. Also, the graph that indicates public supporting rate since 1973 shows the tendency of increase since 1990 to 2016 Marijuana be Made Legal GSS Data The statistics of the Gallup News Service shows the similar result. Public support has increased to 60% in 2016 compared to the 58% in 2013 and the rates tends to increase since the late 1970s (Swift 1). A reason for these phenomena is the medical effects of marijuana. Medical marijuana is effective in relieving pain that were caused by nerve damage, in treating spasticity, glaucoma, movement and can be used as an appetite stimulant especially for the AIDS wasting syndrome or dementia Use Furthermore, marijuana is neuroprotective that it can prevent potential patients from malignant tumors (Van Der Stelt et al. 6475). The other reason for these phenomena is the arrest rate of marijuana offenses. Lee 2 Over 693,000 Americans were arrested in 2013 and over 5 million Americans have been arrested for marijuana charges in the past decade in which simple possession accounts for about 90 percent. People criticizes the waste of law enforcement resources, the outrageous punishments and its impacts towards the lives Therefore, understandings and participations towards the legalization of marijuana are required to let federal and state legislatures reasonably legalize the use of marijuana based on the profound analysis and understandings of the current situation to wisely reflect the public opinion and the necessities of patients and to not to outrageously charge marijuana offenders. To understand the necessities of reasonable legalization of marijuana and the disadvantages of current marijuana laws, several specific victim cases need to be brought and precisely discussed. First case can be represented by the story of Frank Ungaro who was a pizza delivery man selling marijuana for a living and was arrested at the age of 23. 18 month-probation was sentenced as a class 6 felony and the convict left 6 months earlier by attending behavioral treatment program. However, to have a lawful living, it was required to write a personal appeal to the Colorado Division of Real Estates to get a real estate license. Furthermore, it was not allowed to live in Kentucky or Virginia and workplaces asked the explanation about the felony conviction (Kamin and Warner, Plight of the Pre-Legalization Marijuana The most ironic thing of current marijuana law is that the victims of marijuana offenses are the marijuana offenders themselves and they remained as consecutive victims even after they got released. The criminal records have attached stigma to offenders and have excluded the change of beginning lawful lives. The second case can be represented by the racial victims, especially Black Americans. According to the date of American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the Black arrest rate due to marijuana offenses was 537 per 100,000 blacks and this had risen to 716 in 2010 whereas the Lee 3 White arrest rate was 192 per 100,000 whites in both years although the Whites and the Blacks use marijuana at similar rates of 12% and 14% in 2010 and 9% and 10% in 2001 (Edwards et al. 15- 22). These statistics show that although the they are using the marijuana at similar rate, Blacks have been arrested more frequently. That is, Blacks have been more vulnerable under the prohibition and criminalization of marijuana and have been the victims of racial criminal justice system. The last case can be represented by the conflicts between federal and state law. As it was mentioned from the beginning, the federal government and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) have prohibited the entire use of marijuana and classified it as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) that is highly addictive without any medical effects (Crane, Legal Risks with Medical while, some states have legalized marijuana by state law. This has caused chaotic situations to law enforcement officials, doctors, marijuana- related business people and patients. Due to the Supremacy Clause that says the federal law wins the state laws in the case of law conflicts, people are not still free from the conviction of marijuana offense. Physicians cannot legally prescribe marijuana but can write recommendation letters that prove the qualification of patients to have medical marijuana. For patients, they are asked to visit a licensed dispensary to get medical marijuana. Coats v. Dish Network implies the main conflict between the federal and state laws. Coats sued for an injustice termination that happened due to his positive marijuana test result since he was a quadriplegic patient who legally used medical marijuana with state law. However, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled against the plaintiff by interpreting the terms prohibition of legal of the Colorado labor law in terms of federal marijuana laws (Hudak, Conflict between Federal and State Marijuana Laws Claims a Furthermore, several legal experts and lawyers discussed the interpretation and Lee 4 application of laws in the American Bar Association webinar Ethics and the Business of Rule of Profession conduct of the American Bar Association specifies that the lawyers not counsel a client to engage, or assist a client, in conduct that the lawyer knows is criminal or This caused confusion to lawyers whether they would be able to advise marijuana-related businesses, patients, and doctors or not State and Federal Marijuana Laws Create Ethical Complications for Lawyers To address chaotic legal situations that severely affect lives, to reflect the public opinion towards the legalization of marijuana use, and to assure the safe medical use of marijuana for patients and physicians, the entire legalization of medical marijuana for both federal and state aspects is needed. To realize it, participation and concerns towards the legalization of medical marijuana are required. Individuals can participate through the state medical marijuana election or by signing up for the CARRERS ACT in the Drug Policy Alliance Website. By signing up for the CAREERS ACT, individuals can convey the support and importance of medical marijuana legalization to the Senate to act for the legalization. To participate in persuading others to support, individuals can sign up the marijuana legalization websites like Drug Policy Alliance, National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) and Marijuana Policy Project (MPP). Furthermore, individuals can take part in campaigns of these organizations or donate to help them manifesting the entire legalization of medical marijuana. Although the federal government have prohibited marijuana, lots of states have legalized use of marijuana and public supports have been increasing. However, due to the federal prohibition of marijuana, there have been victims like ex-marijuana offenders who are excluded, patients who had difficulties in getting or taking medical marijuana and lawyers who got confused with the current law system and racial discriminations in marijuana arrests. To address this social, medical Lee 5 and legal problems, entire legalization of medical marijuana should be passed for both federal and state legislatures. To realize this, the actions of individuals are required through the campaigns and donations. Most importantly, actions can be well represented by practicing one important votes for medical marijuana elections and this can contribute to establishing more liberal, safer, and more justice United States.
