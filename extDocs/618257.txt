Liam 1 Liam Travers Oana Cimpean Composition 2 January 28, 2017 Intermediate Draft Being beautiful is a standard that nearly every human wishes to achieve. There are many different ways to improve looks and cosmetics are one of the most simple ways to do so. Women wake up early to put their makeup on and men use shaving cream to shave their beards. Although cosmetics are used everyday, most people usually think about how their favorite body wash was approved or if animal testing was used on it to satisfy regulatory requirements. Whether or not animal testing is ethical generates huge controversy throughout academic study and social media. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) believe that animal testing should be abolished and have campaigned through social media to spread their belief. On the other side has allegedly halted animal testing but still use it if authorities it. Many are still skeptical of anti animal testing and PETA has butted heads with them in the past in an effort to expose them for misconduct. Although no animal testing would be an ideal standard for cosmetics, realistically, it might not be completely feasible for some companies just yet. To combine the interests of both of stakeholders, there should be integration of alterative methods overtime until animal testing is no longer needed. PETA is the largest animal rights organization in the world. It started out with two founders. Although PETA began its campaign with only two people, the Liam 2 1980s, by 2015 it had a worldwide membership of more than three million (PETA). They are often described as radical in their belief and have conducted many movements and undercover operations to press their standard. on animal testing is to, globally expose and end the use of animals in experiments as stated in their website. PETA have conducted various efforts to end animal testing such as, undercover campaigns to educate the agencies to stop funding and conducting experiments on and funding humane non-animal (PETA). PETA has publically called out on their website titled, used to be included on the cruelty free This article on their website discusses the aleged loopholes implement to use animal testing while being pubically advertiesed as animal testing free. is one of the largest cosmetics companies founded in 1909. mission statement is about creating cosemetics to make people beautiful and it has, itself the mission of offereing alll women and men worldwide the best of cosemetics innovation in terms of quality, efficiancy, and (LOREAL). On FAQ page they discuss their stance on animal testing. states that, no longer test on animals any of products or any of (LOREAL) but this has been the subject of much contreversy. In their other questions in the FAQ, it discusses that In China, regulatory authorities carry out within their evaluation centers animal tests for finished cosmetics products before these are placed on their Although supports animal testing free products they are not fully testing free. have been chastised in social media for their on-the-fence stance about animinal testing and it would be in their best interest to adopt a stronger stance on the matter. Liam 3 There has been a contemporary movement for anti animal testing which both stakeholders wish to follow. Since there have been alternative methods to animal testing in development the switch is there. Both stakeholders will benefit from this: PETA will benefit because their goal is to stop animal testing and will benefit because they will be able to be completely animal testing free. has been critisized in the past for being partly animal testing free so being able to label their product fully animal testing free is a significant benefit. Accepting this propasal will remove any doubt that is animal testing free from critics and potentially increse their sales for the inclusion of the animal cruelty free target audience. To prove that this target audince is significant enough benefit the Comitee for Resposible Medicene has conducted a survey that, percent of Americans oppose testing cosemetics products on The methodology of this test was weighted by age, sex, geographic region, race, and education to ensure an accurate representation of the total adult (greater than 18 years of age) population and they 1009 Out of the surveyed group 72 percent opposed animal testing so it would be beneficial for to be animal testing free. My proposed solution is possible as there are different alternative methods to animal testing. According to, to animal by R.E. Hester and R.M. Harrison, one alternative method for example, is called in This provides three dimnesional models of human skin to be tested on with cosmetics as opposed to animal testing. This method is also commercially availible with products such as EPISKIN and EpiDerm. Some might argue that these methods are to expensive and that implementing these methods would cost company time and money. to animal also covers this topic as it states that, problems can be reduced if the criteria for test selection (and especially for the novelty for a test and Liam 4 the need for it) and for prevalidation are rigorously It also discusses that, chemicals should be very carefully and that, is no reason for having more than three or four laboratories perform the same test in a multi- laboratory Basically there should be more precision and better data systems so that experiments do not have to be repeated and take up extra costs. Another problem that one would run into switching to animal testing would be lack of cooperation by the company itself or by the individual workers. Alternatives to Animal Testing covers this by stating this problem can be avoided by, an appropriate training stage training indivdual workers. These methods have been proven to be successful in the, sponsard study on in vitro tests for skin corrosivity. Ever since the dawn of the information era, word of animal testing and people have become more educated on what it actually is. A majority of people believe that animal testing is unethical and while that may be the case, switching to alternative methods would put a financial strain on most companies. Through the stated proposal, if were given time to transfer to non animal testing methods both stakeholders would achieve their goal. Though it may take some time, switching to non animal testing is possible. Liam 5 Works Cited Animal Testing  PETA. PETA, n.d. Web. 30 Jan. 2017. Group, History: Highlights, Stages of  - Group. n.d.
