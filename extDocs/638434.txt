Student 1 Student Lisa Dubois ENC 1102 29 January 2017 Recycling Electronic Devices and Reducing Data Theft Data theft is a horrid thing that occurs more than most would like to believe. When people think of having personal data stolen, they think of hackers. But this is not necessarily the case, many devices that people just throw away still contain precious data that can be easily accessed by anyone looking for it. Data theft is not the worst thing that occurs from just throwing out old electronic devices, there are other secondary effects that many people do not even consider. This includes pollution and health effects for the surrounding communities. There is a simple fix to this problem, though, simply recycling old electronic devices. There are even free services around the Tampa Bay Area, such as Urban e-Recycling. People usually do not consider this as an alternative to just throwing out the old device, and if it is a business there can be great fines for having client data not being properly disposed of. Although Urban e- goals are to electronics down to and to never charge for their services, analyses of the images show that this organization is more focused on minimizing waste and maximizing profits through the items that the accept. Urban e-Recycling persuades the customers, and audience, to call them and set up an appointment for them to pick up items that you plan to give them to recycle through image A. In image A, there is a little girl and she is smiling and happy while sitting in a truck. This is a great example of a couple of the rhetorical appeal such pathos, the appeal to the emotions. As Lane, Student 2 Lee, McKee, McIntyre, and Pantelides stated, when a writer uses images, songs, and other types of nontextual media, he or she is often attempting to engage a emotions 20). The emotions that the audience feels are happiness and joy because there is nothing much better than seeing a young kid smiling and happy. Most of the time when a young child smiles, as is the case in image A, anyone else around will smile and automatically be put into a better mood. Further analysis of image A shows the logo on the young hat that says e- This is an example of the logos, which is a method of persuasion that the author may use to persuade the audience by demonstrating credibility and authority, according to McKee and McIntyre. The logo shows that they are a professional company and that they care about how they appear to their customers. This company has more of an amusing advertising because it has a more positive effect on the customer, which makes it more memorable. This form of advertisement is important for this type of company due to the fact that they are a small, local company with a small range of customers at this point. Image A also has a rhetorical appeal to kairos, which is an appeal to timeliness, more specifically, in this case, a reference to a current crisis. This current crisis could be foreshadowed as all of the pollutions that we as humans as a whole are producing 41). This year alone, there has been over three million tons of electronic waste just thrown out. This equates to about million tons of it every year. This is equivalent to throwing out 800 laptops every single (The World Counts). On the chalkboard, image B, Urban e-Recycling persuades people that using their business gives you essentially a blank slate. The chalkboard reads Urban E Recycling gives you a GREEN This is an allusion to the Latin phrase which translates to the blank slate. This image actually flows fairly well with image A because of the fact that image A Student 3 was a child and they are born with a blank slate. This is a belief that when you are born you are pure and have not been influenced by your environment and other people yet. Image B is an appeal to pathos, which is shown simply through the phrase that is written. Most people have done things they regret in their life and this advertisement makes it appear almost as if one can make up for this by recycling their old electronic device. The could be referring to starting off with a fresh start on your consumption and elimination of trash. Image B also has a good rhetorical appeal of logos. The logos in this image can be from it making sense logically to recycle your old items so that you are just having your junk put into the earth for future generations to have to deal with. Instead, you are continuing to keep this metaphorical slate clean by having old electronics being reused. Thus, Urban e-Recycling uses ethos, logos, pathos, and kairos in order to persuade potential customers to use their electronic recycling services. The audience for these particular images is any adult in Tampa Bay and surrounding areas, although they do have customers in other counties and states across America. Through these visual images, Urban e-Recycling aims to gain more popularity not just for them, but for the safe recycling of electronic devices industry as a whole. The mission statement for Urban e- Recycling is that they believe that people will do the right thing if easy, safe and This company has absolutely no income coming from their customers because they do not charge for their service. Instead, the money they make comes from the selling of the precious metals inside of certain electronics, such as copper from wire or the sapphire in the iPhone (Urban e-Recycling). The organization of the images used by this company includes the rhetorical strategies of ethos, logos, pathos, and kairos. The main things that they use in their images is pathos and logos, which are the appeals to emotions and logic. These images are both Student 4 for recycling of electronic devices, but they both contain different messages: image A uses a smiling child to help build a connection with their clients while image B is concentrated on the logical appeal of a blank slate and starting fresh (WC 1029).
