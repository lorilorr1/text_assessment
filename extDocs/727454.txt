Calvin Crino Emil Smith First Year Composition 4/2/17 The Importance of Accessibility in Public Transport In this modern age there is an acclaimed progress, a goal of unity and inclusion where all people have equal opportunity; However this goal has not been achieved. Those with disability be it physical, or mental are not allotted the same accessibility to public resources and are therefore excluded from this progress. Accessibility is important and often overlooked, however in order for total inclusion to be achieved it must be the guiding light for public transport design despite the possible costs. In a democratic system every person is able to weigh in on what they think is right or wrong, together many determine how the world aught be. However despite this ideal of democracy, a complication of movement can hinder a ability to act in the democratic process. Accessibility directly affects how those with difficulty getting around can impact their society. Consider the conclusions of Ahmad in his 2015 paper on independent-mobility such as improved health care delivery, employment equity, and inclusive education sited at specific spatial locations demand that public transport services must be accessible to disabled people to enable them to easily gain (p. 198). The idea that ahmad is trying to convey is that if public transport does not provide for those with disability it essentially makes all the public services private. This parallel between spatial exclusion and discrimination begs the question, why allow those with disability to be ignored? Given how much society as a whole has fought discrimination, allowing those with Crino 2 disability to be ignored debases the human rights modern society holds dear. Therefore accessibility is a requirement in order to uphold human rights. Social exclusion is defined by a lack of participation in society. The exclusion may result of either active separation or unconscious design decisions, which in turn defines a inclusion. According to Preston and Raje (2007) in their paper on the subject, are focusing on participation in civil society. In part, this is determined by access to work, education, healthcare, shops, leisure facilities, welfare, finance and housing, not all of which have a material transport 152). In this statement preston and raje explain social exclusion, as an inversely related occurrence to accessibility. The lack of accessibility no matter the reason, will lead to a general increase in excluded peoples . Considering this, the inadvertent inaccessibility that causes this exclusion between those with disability and those without needs to be actively decreased in order to reach a goal of total inclusion. The problem is that the plight of those with disabilities is known by most people, it also is not often thought about. Despite almost one fifth of americans having disabilities the average person is unaware of the because they are without disability(US Census Bureau Public Information Office, 2016). Because of this miss-proportionally perspective the importance of accessibility is greatly diminished in the eyes of the average citizen. However this does not mean that accessibility is not important, in fact it means that it is more important that it is given credit for. If accessibility was fully implemented the awareness of the average person would increase promoting the ideal of unity. The most common argument against increased accessibility is the cost of the proposed changes to public transport. The fact of the matter is that there are many places where accessible public transport is nearly non existent and therefore the changes required to achieve total Crino 3 accessibility would cost multiples of the current systems cost. However despite the proposed cost of implementation the cost of non implementation is greater. Every person whose economic potential is hindered by inaccessibility due to disability costs society, the total of which is greater than the cost to implement the semi specialized systems, like ramps and signage, into public transport to create accessibility. In conclusion, given that accessibility directly affects the unity of a society, as well as judges the equity of public services; it is necessary that it be used as the primary guide in the construction of public transport, despite the cost, and perception of such programs.
