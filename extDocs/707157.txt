Student 1 Student Lisa DuBois ENC 1102 5 March 2017 Reaching a Compromise Between GMO Answers and GMO Awareness Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have been a frequently discussed, and controversial recent topic. GMOs are scientifically modified, specifically by altering their genome by using genetic engineering (Powell). The main purpose behind this is that these genetically modified foods, such as rice and corn, can be produced in more nutritious and bountiful quantities. Examples of GMOs currently being produced include: corn, cotton, soybean, canola, potato, tomato, rice, apple, wheat, squash, and plum (Powell). One of the major proclaimed risks of GMO consumption is that it could potentially damage the environment. This is due to the fact that many GMOs have some sort of resistance to pesticides, and this could consequently lead to farmers increasing the amount of pesticides they use. This could inadvertently cause damage to surrounding ecosystems, and could be detrimental to the health of humans (Brassard). This controversial point of interest has understandably fostered a division between opinions on both sides of the GMO argument, and there are many different stakeholders of this topic. A big supporter of GMOs is GMO Answers. An opposing stakeholder is GMO Awareness, which leans more towards an anti-GMO approach. This dissonance of ideas and opinions can be remedied by certain steps that serve to mediate. This should include more discussion and cooperation between the two stakeholders. Student 2 The first stakeholder mentioned is GMO Answers. This organization serves to inform the world of the potential benefits and uses of GMOs, and this can be clearly seen by their website that asks and answers numerous questions. An important aspect of the information presented by GMO Answers is who is cited as a resource. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, the U.S. Drug and Food Administration, the American Medical Association, the World Health Organization, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, and The American Medical Association are examples of agencies that also support GMOs Labels: 10 Things You Should Know About GMO main goal is highlighted by their statement: hope to help you on your journey to better understand how your food is grown. As the developers of biotech seeds with our farmer and agriculture partners, we want to make information about GMOs easier to find, analyze and Acknowledgement for The second, opposing stakeholder is GMO Awareness, and this organization takes a pretty clear anti-GMO stance. Their ideals can be better understood by noting their association with other groups such as: the Institute for Responsible Technology, NonGMO Project, Label GMOs, and the Allergy Kids Foundation. Furthermore, GMO mission is to down original, valid study the study, article, and related own communicate to be a humble resource for healthy Ultimately, GMO Answers aims to clarify any misleading or misunderstood information about genetically modified products, especially in regards to their detrimental possibilities awareness about the risks of genetically modified food Mediating between these two stakeholders that are on polar sides of the controversy of GMOs will definitely prove challenging, but there are some ways that this can be done. In order Student 3 to better understand how this can be done, it is important to analyze the similarities and differences between the two. With regards to similarities, both stakeholders aim to inform the public on GMOs. This can be seen by how both organizations provide and analyze many studies throughout their website. On the other hand, the information being presented by each stakeholder seems to only support their own side. This is proof of the inherent bias that can be present on both sides. In order to prevent this, a proposed compromise can include the cooperation between both groups when analyzing these articles. Representatives from GMO Answers and GMO Awareness could meet and discuss/study the same published research sources and come to a more agreed upon conclusion with GMOs. Considering these stakeholders most likely are not located near each other, they could hold online conferences when conducting their research. Ultimately, this could lead to the creation of a novel organization that is composed of initial supporters of GMO Answers and GMO Awareness. However, this is easier said than done. This cooperation between both stakeholders will only be possible if they are willing to be open- minded to conversation and opposing opinions. The collaboration between these organizations will benefit them and society as a whole as more credible information will be spread about GMOs. Bridging the gap between differing ideals can seem daunting, especially when considering stakeholders in highly debated and provocative topics such as the use of GMOs. It is completely understandable and expected for people to have contrasting opinions, but it is important to reach compromises and engage in dialogue. In the case of GMO Answers and GMO Awareness, this can be done by conducting joint research and analysis of GMO studies. Eventually, the main goal would be to have a cooperative organization dedicated to further disseminating facts and information about genetically modified organisms.
