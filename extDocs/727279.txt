Braganca 1 Marcela Tozatti Fiuza de Braganca Andrew DeCarion ENC 1102 25 April 2017 Looking Foward to Evaluate, Not Deteriorate When talking about delicious food, the majority of the Americans will think about that huge juicy piece of steak running through their mouth directly to their stomach. More than just a piece of food, eating meat became part of the American culture, a behavior that became normal to most Americans. But this goes beyond humans modern culture, this behavior was actually influenced by the Australopithecus, in other words, the humans ancestors. In fact, eating meat is part of human nature; if humans can digest it, why not eat it? However, the consumption of meat in the United States has skyrocketed drastically from the early until today, making the cattle industry the leading agriculture industry in the nation. This absurd increase in consumption had cause an horrific impact on the health, but not only. Indeed, the demand certainly  the industries to increase their production which led to a greater environment deforestation and to a greater animal mistreatment. We have to keep in mind that the exaggerated consumption of meat affects more than our health; in fact, it also contributes to environmental deterioration and animal abuse, and the only effective way to reverse this situation is by changing our diet. The environment is one of the three victims of the meat industry that suffered from this meat revolution. Like any other business, when the demand increases the supply has also to go Braganca 2 along with the rhythm to avoid inflations; yet, when the beef industry started to expand, more land, water, and food were needed to sustain that growth in consumption. To be more precise, to make a quarter-pound hamburger needed: 6.7 lbs of grains and forage, 52.8 gallons of water for drinking water and irrigating feed crops, 74.5 square feet for grazing and growing feed crops, and 1,036 Btus for feed production and  (Barclay, Eliza). Keeping in mind that these numbers relates to quarter-pound hamburger; now image 52.2 billions pounds, which is the total meat consumption of the american population per year. Thousand of forests hectares are destroyed per year to open space for the cattle and thousands of liters of clean water are  so industries can keep up the rhythm of the meat consumption of the population. Not stopping there, waste are one of the main contributors to environmental negligence. According to the researcher Deanna Ferreira, cattle and other animals in the ruminant family, contribute a significant percentage of methane into the  (542). In reality, agricultural activities is the leading cause of methane emission, representing a total of 16% of all greenhouse emissions Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions ). Just as the Agreement of Paris helped nations to control their emission of carbon dioxide in industries and cars, controlling emissions of methane would also be helpful to the environment, avoiding change in global temperature. By that, avoiding the consumption of meat will make one responsible for helping the environment to improve. Besides the destruction around us, consuming meat also causes a worrisome impact within our bodies. Meat lovers will say that our human ancestors used to eat meat, and it is part of human nature to consume meat. In fact they did, but the Australopithecus, or cave-men, had to eat meat because it was the only source available for survival at that time; but even though, they Braganca 3 used to consume much less than the average American does now. The world changed, and habits that were considered convenient in the past are not necessarily convenient today. People eat meat because it tastes good and it is also a good source of amino acids for humans, but what about the part in which red meat is heavily composed of saturated fat? According to a research conducted by doctors in Spain, higher consumption of red meat and processed meat is associated with an increased risk of total cardiovascular  (Boada, Luis), caused when fat accumulates in our blood vessels. Some people think that physiological diseases have most of its relation with genetics, but is pretty much the contrary. Our environment has a greater influence in cardiovascular, and even cancer, development than our genetic inheritance. For instance, habits such as smoking, physical exercise, and specially food intake have a direct influence in cardiovascular and cancer development. As stated in research, he  that dietary intervention (mainly reducing processed meat intake) may be a promising approach for prevention of cancers of the colon, esophagus, liver, stomach and bladder, and type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular  (Boada, Luis). Reducing meat consumption or, even better, introducing a plant-based diet to life helps not only the environment, but quality of life. After discussing the effects of the manufacturing process of the product and the effects of it in body, now it is time to discuss about the source of the product itself, the animals. When people eat a piece of steak they do not necessary think I am eating a one living  they just eat and enjoy the pleasure of it. This happens because eating meat has become natural to humans, but it does not mean is ethical. The mistreatment of animals inside the agricultural industries is a subject not openly discussed as it should be; for some reason people tend to ignore Braganca 4 this issue and live their lives like nothing wrong is happening. Some examples of animal cruelty that occurs within the industries according to PETA include: burning cows for identification purposes, cutting testicles without pain reliefs, forced intake of food until they cannot even stand their own weight, inappropriate shelter in which they die of heat or frozen and are constantly smashed for lack of space, and living under extremely dirty conditions favorable to diseases. Yet, PETA fights over this cruelty by promoting public education, cruelty investigations, research, animal rescue, legislation, special events, celebrity involvement, and protest  (PETA) trying to spread awareness over the population. Just as humans beings, animals are also breathing creatures that seeks for love, comfort, and happiness. However, supporting this industry makes you responsible for supporting animal abuse. Changing your diet into a plant-based diet or even just reducing your meat intake will improve your life quality, avoid environmental destruction, and prevent animal abuse. A concern that one could have when considering changing their diet would be the lack of vitamins, such as iron, if one stops eating meat. According to a research conducted by Janet Hunt comparing vegetarians and non vegetarians, although vegetarians tend to have lower iron stores than omnivores, they appear to have no greater incidence of iron deficiency . In other words, the supply of iron that meat offers to humans is , and not essential; for instance, living a plant-based diet gives humans the enough amount of iron needed for survival. Calcium and amino-acids are also two factors that people tend to be concern about it when taking a vegetarian diet into consideration. Foods like beans, spinach, and mushrooms are rich in all three of those components. Plant foods have every property that is essential to sustain the human body: vitamins, carbs, proteins, and healthy fats. Moreover, they do not, by any circumstances, provoke Braganca 5 any cardiovascular diseases (as stated earlier) like animal products do. Removing or reducing meat intake from your diet will make you live a longer and healthier life. responsible for the good and not for the bad; help to change your surroundings for the best by changing your habits. This topic has been around for more than thirty-seven years, when PETA was founded, and even though it seems unnoticed for big part of the population. Documentaries, magazines, articles, and research are constantly updated and published with the purpose to open eyes to reinforce the damages caused by the agricultural industry. Fortunately, according to Janet Larsen, a Stanford alumni, who conducts research on global environmental trends shows that meat-eating across the country fell from the 2004 high point of 184 pounds per person to 171 pounds in  and estimates that further reduction will summarize to a 10 percent drop over the years. People are actually changing their habits little by little, and by doing so they help not only to save animals lives, but to save the planet earth, and their own lives.
