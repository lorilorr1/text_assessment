During the years between 1917 and 1948, dozens of thousands of soldiers and civilians lost their lives fighting over this land, where one believes religiously and the other fairly. Some became refuges and others became independents and people still ask, has the discourse of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict changed over time since 1948 and how does Belfour Declaration affected the Palestinians were influenced by Belfour declaration and specially between 1917 and 1948 where the conflict of Israelis and Palestinians start and never ends, and that clarifies how that was impacted during 1917 -1948.

Although number of the Palestinians are living in the land after the war 1948 and the war zone is much safer than before and the people still hurt of occupying their home, therefore, the Balfour Declaration has harmed Palestine irreparably and should not have been written for good and it would have changed future to a better generation. The announcement of the Declaration declaimed as follows: Government view with favor the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non- Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other The Immigration of Jews started head Palestine Promised after the delectation of Belfour was announced to create Palestine as land of the Jews. At the time, the Jews were 5% of Palestine population. The first impact that influenced Palestine is the result of having 600,000 Jews moving to Palestine after issuance Balfour law. After the Balfour declared his statement to the world, the Jews killed a numerous number of the British soldiers and took over their military bases and that causes a lot of deaths of English and Arab people.

The United States obtained a central solution by assisting the resolution of the United Nations and suggesting negotiations between Palestinians and Jews. At the time to The Jews in UK and USA forced the leaders that we must do something about it, months later the British government have required the United Nations to declare a situation of the Israel-Palestine conflict. The isolated Palestine to four sections, three Jews control and one Arabs, in fact, Jerusalem would remain international controlled.

It was resulted in 750,00 refugee (60% of the population), over 60,000 people were killed in the war. Over 750,000 Palestinians were removed and became refuges thus of the 1948 war which prompted the establishing of Israel State. None of them were ever permitted to come back to their home or groups from what they were banished and the population of Palestinian refugees has kept on developing in the time that has gone since 1948.
