Ciancimino 1 Ayrton Ciancimino Theodosiou Section 075 The Fight for the Improved Sustainability of Seafood and its Industry The commercial fishing industry is a multimillion-dollar company that provides seafood to many households, restaurants and companies. In recent years, a sort of blue revolution has been rising, pushing for the conservation of both the oceans and the marine life that make their homes in them. Many people have urged the fishing industry and its numerous companies to improve their practices to avoid harmful methods injure marine life. Practices such as overfishing, bottom trawling, bycatching and the sourcing of watch list species. Two groups at opposite ends of the spectrum are Greenpeace, an organization that seeks reform for the environment, and Rinehart Food Services, a company that provides products to a number of restaurants and businesses, including seafood products. The fishing industry continues to have many controversies over the state of its practices with the industry on one side fighting to secure their profit while environmental and wildlife groups seek change in these practices, but through of research going into modifying these practices a compromise may be established. Many groups and individuals alike have spoken out against the dangers to the planets oceans posed by neglectful fishing practices. Practices such as overfishing which involves the continued catching of species resulting the rapid depletion of said species greatly damages marine ecosystems. The Food and Agriculture Organization found that of the fish stocks surveyed in the South China Sea the majority were or fully (Ambio 64) This statistic can be seen not only there, but worldwide. Another practice, bottom trawling, involves Ciancimino 2 the dragging of nets across sea bottoms causes great damage to sea floor life. (Greenpeace). Aside from the effect on marine life, many fishing industries are also teaming with terrible work conditions and abuse of workers, especially in foreign industries. Reinhart Food Services is a national company committed to providing restaurants, delis, sports venues, and other groups a variety of food and utensil products (Rinehart). They also lend to their customers other services, including menu planning and nutrition advising. They were founded in 1972 in La Crosse, Wisconsin, and from there have grown to be a nation-wide organization with twenty-nine distribution centers and one meat product center (Rinehart). The company boasts many high-profile customers including Burger King and Subway. Rinehart also produces its own food centric magazine distributed to all of the companies suppliers, and employees Greenpeace is an organization that has been fighting for environmental change and a greener future since 1971. It is the independent campaigning urging against environmental degradation, utilizing protesting and creative to put an end to injustices against the planet (Greenpeace). They fight several campaigns against many threats including global warming, the destruction of rainforests, and ocean devastation. The organization combats these threats in a number of different ways, often with volunteers at the forefront of their protests and actions. Those wishing not to get directly involved may choose to donate to the cause. Greenpeace also performs much research, writing a variety of articles in advocation of environmental protection and about planetary destruction. The two organizations have come at odds as of recently, with Greenpeace protesting against practices in obtaining fish and the lack of sustainability in them. Greenpeace, in one of its research articles, rated twelve major food service industries in order of fishing Ciancimino 3 practice sustainability. Only three companies passed, and the worst scored company of the bunch was Rinehart Food Services. Greenpeace found that the company was guilty of sourcing fish stocks that are depleted, such as Bigeye and Yellowfin Tuna. The company was also found to source Bluefin Tuna, a heavily depleted species on watch (Progress Illinois). Greenpeace urges the company to change its sourcing and seafood obtainment habits to better conserve the ocean and protect against overfishing. The issue of bad fishing practices in the fishing industry continues to be a combatted issue, but many groups and companies are looking to improve themselves for the improvement of the health. Rinehart can be one such company to follow suit and improve its practices. A reduction in their overfishing would not only benefit marine life, but their own profit and revenue. With higher sustainability in their practices the continued longevity of the schools they fish will mean higher yields in future years. If their yields are overfished now and depleted, their main resources will be gone and their revenue will crash. The problem can be addressed with a solution involving the cooperation of both groups, both Rinehart and Greenpeace for heighted action in renovating fishing practices. A fundraiser can be instituted in place to help raise funds to allow for better research in better fishery science as well as better equipment and incentives for fishing employees to practice safe and sustainable practices. A fundraiser on both sides to raise money for improved equipment and research funds to utilize sustainable practices is worthwhile compromise to achieve the goal of a greener planet for Greenpeace and an improved reputation for Rinehart. Many groups have used fundraising in the past as a successful method of gathering funds for a notable cause. Research suggests that one fundraising method that provides a higher yield of funds comparable to other fundraising Ciancimino 4 methods is the use of by organizations (Drug Discovery Today 1866) This method involves the price matching of organizations the amount donated by the people. People feel more obliged to donate knowing that other groups will also contribute to the fund. In the case of the Greenpeace-Rinehart compromise, any funds raised by the people can then be matched by Greenpeace and Rinehart Food Services to create a higher yielding fund. So if the people generate $1000 worth of donations, if both organizations match half of that value and contribute $500, the fund will total $2000 to be put for the improvement of practices and research. This money can easily be put to good use by Rinehart Food Services to improve the sustainability of their seafood sect of their industry. They can research alternative species to fish to avoid overfishing and find improved not fully fished areas to do so. Bad fishing practices has been a raging controversy in recent times, with environmental and wildlife groups advocating for better practices to be used by the fishing industry. Two contenders in this this issue is the food distributer Rinehart Food Services who is committed to providing quality food, though possibly not always environmentally consciously obtained, and Greenpeace the peaceful protesting environmental group seeking to push others to more ecosystem friendly practices. These groups can ultimately, despite their differences, come to term to achieve their goals through compromise. Rinehart can continue to procure funds through the distribution of seafood products, and Greenpeace can continue mission for a greener future and planet. Both groups can also better their reputations, with Rinehart being able to gain a reputation for high sustainability in their food products and being able to get off bad practice watch list, and Greenpeace can add another company to their list of improvements. The compromise of fundraising and the matching of funds can greatly benefit to the cause and will lead to the beneficial success of both sides. The thriving of both these companies Ciancimino 5 will not only further their own success, but the can be one more stone in the improvement of the fishing industry.
