Zhang 1 Heng Zhang Casey Clague ENC 1102.076 5/3/2017 Air pollution in China In China, when you wake up in every morning, the first thing you have to do is to check air quality index (AQI). Because after you know AQI, you can make full preparations to face bad weather whole day. If you do so, your health will be affected by bad air. In China, no one like air pollution, but less of them care about air pollution and want to solve this issue. Factories rely too much on fossil fuels, although some of them know the more fossil fuels they use, the worse the air will become, no one stop burning fossil fuels until the local government warns them. Many people think air pollution is not a serious issue in China, but they are totally wrong. Air pollution becomes worse and worse in recent years in China. Some people died because of air pollution. According to a study from article, pollution is responsible for killing 1.6 million Chinese a year, about one sixth of all the premature deaths in the (Kaplan, 2015, pp. 4) This is true, air pollution is killing innocent people, we need to decrease the use of fossil fuels to improve air quality, if we do that, more and more people will die. In China, fossil fuels are one of the main sources that cause air pollution. According to Covert, fuels provide substantial economic (Covert et al. 2016, p.117) for example, using fossil fuels is cheaper than using clear energy. In fact, although using fossil fuels saves a lot of money, it results in air pollution. Factories have to reduce the use of fossil fuels, Zhang 2 they can try to use clear energy, although the price becomes much more expensive, this can help people to improve air pollution. Air pollution brings serious threats, it not only makes people become sick, but also kills people. According to article, some diseases are caused by air pollution, like asthma, COPD and lung cancer. In his article, he also points out the reasons why they are caused by air pollution. For example, ambient ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulphur dioxide levels were associated with increased hospital admission for (Guan et al. 2016, p. 1942) If asthma becomes worse, it will result in death. Other two diseases will also result in death, if patients be treated well at the first time. But fortunately, these three diseases can be avoided. For example, if PM 2.5 is higher than standard data, people can try to stay at home instead of going outside, or wear a mask to reduce the amount of hazardous substances go through the body. But if the PM2.5 is really high, go outside and close every window. According to Guan and his partners, China, where air pollution has become a major threat to public health, public awareness of the detrimental of air pollution on respiratory health is in relation to haze (Guan et al. 2016, p. 1939) Before air pollution gets worse, less people or no one care about this issue, this also result in recent worse air pollution. When air quality becomes worse, more and more people start thinking of air pollution. Although it is hard to improve recent air quality, there still has many solutions. In Shanghai, China, I think almost every local citizen misses the 2010 World Expo, because during the Expo, air quality became clear than any time, although this was controlled by local government. For example, according to article, burning of straw was strictly prohibited (SEPB, 2010), which is a major source of air pollutants in the harvest (Huang Zhang 3 et al. 2013, p. 5928) During these times, every factory was controlled seriously by the local government in Shanghai. Without the burning of straw and large amount of fossil fuels, the air pollution has been improved shortly during the 2010 World Expo. But unfortunately, after the 2010 World Expo ended, the local government prohibit the burning of straw and large amount of fossil fuels, the air quality became worse and worse just like the day before the 2010 World Expo. From the 2010 World Expo, we know that the air pollution could be improved by us, but less of us want to do that. We just care about the air pollution and hope our government can improve the air pollution, but we take real action. Air pollution is especially dangerous to younger people, because they are much more fragile than adults. Many parents want their children be affected by the air pollution, so they pay their money to local communities and hospitals to reduce the air pollution. According to study, respondents reported being willing to make a financial contribution to improve air quality in both the community (52.6%) and hospital (70.2%) (Wang et al. 2015) Because parents care about their children, they are willing to pay these money to help their children stay away from the air pollution. not too late to take action to save our living environment. As normal citizens, we have the ability to control the air pollution, but we can try to improve it. For example, we can take public transportation instead of driving our own cars, factories can try to using clean energy instead of using fossil fuels.
