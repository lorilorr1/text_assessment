Sulbaran 1 Helio Sulbaran Professor Karen Hanson ENC 1102 29 January, 2017 Project 2 Intermediate Draft The Electoral College has been established in the United States since its inception. The purpose of the Electoral College is to elect the president of the United States. Because it was adopted so long ago, it has become a highly debated topic. The argument most discussed goes on whether the Electoral College should be eliminated, or whether it should be updated, and become more of a popular vote election. The National Popular Vote, or NPV, defends the idea of updating the Electoral College system, and becoming a direct democracy (About). To support their opinion, they use a prolific amount of advertisements. The video titled you should support the National Popular explains their position on why the Electoral College should be updated, and how the people can help. Another advertisement, is a picture on where people can be seen protesting on eradicating the Electoral College. These two pieces of advertisement utilize many different rhetorical appeals, which successfully explain their position and attract people to their side. The NPV has an ongoing campaign, on where they are trying to pass their proposition of following the national popular vote for the next presidential election in 2020. They have launched multiple videos trying to persuade people to support their campaign. An example of one of their video is you should support the National Popular This video utilizes rhetorical appeals to try to persuade people to support the NPV ideas. The video is one-minute- long, with only the president of the organization, Barry Fadem, talking about how the proposition is the only way to elect the president of the United States, on where the candidates Sulbaran 2 that wins the most popular votes receives the most Electoral College votes. He explains that they 61% of the way to our goal of and need are 105 more electoral votes for the national popular vote plan for to be in effect for This means that they need 105 more Electoral College members to vote in support of the proposition and they will have reached their goal. The video also mentions what to do to contribute to the cause. However, before they mentioned it, they present the rhetorical devices of ethos, logos, pathos and Kairos, to hook the audience and convince them to support their proposition. The ethos comes in the video by having the President of the organization being the speaker of the video. This provides a sense of authority, because the President himself is the one speaking, and it provides a sense of seriousness and importance because the president made time to make this video. The video possesses logos in the fact that they mentioned that they are 65% of the way, with 105 Electoral College votes left to pass their proposition. This demonstrates that their work is paying off, and that they have the facts to prove that their organization is gaining enough support. Pathos is present throughout the whole video, with the application of music in the background. The music works by creating a mood of serenity, calmness, and welcoming, on where the person watching the video feels welcomed. It also brings pathos with the words the President used to describe the amending of the constitution. By using the words unnecessary and totally to describe the process of amending the constitution, it gives a negative image on the previous efforts to amend it, and it displays the organizations feelings towards the amending of the constitution. In addition, the video talks about the possibility of having the proposition made a reality by the 2020 elections. After displaying the facts, the video starts to talk about what the audience can do before 2020. This brings in Kairos, on where they Sulbaran 3 ask the viewers to write their legislators to support the NPV and pass their proposition in their states. This gives the video a time window to complete the proposal. The NPVs campaign of passing a popular vote for the election has gained attention during the last couple of months, especially with the recent 2016 elections. The NPV took this to their advantage, and created ads focusing around what was occurring during the election. An example of the ads they used is picture 1 with the American flag as the background, and in white letters, a text that says, can fix the Electoral College. Use the link above to tell your legislators to support the National Popular They used the picture via Twitter, and tweeted it December 19, 2016. This is the date when the Electoral College members meet, and cast their Electoral College vote (National Archive). The NPV used this day to their advantage to tweet this picture, and quoted it, meet today, so a good time to ask legislators to adopt a popular vote for They used the date to support their picture, and used the rhetorical appeals of Kairos and pathos to support their claim. The presence of Kairos is shown in the picture with the picture asking the people to tell their legislator to support the NPV, and used the time of Electoral College members voting day, to write now to their legislator, so for the next election is based on the popular vote system. Pathos is also present in the picture, by having the American flag as the background. The American flag brings the feeling of patriotism. They used it to help and motivate the audience to feel patriotic and that writing their legislator is the right thing to do, the American thing to do. Also, by having the words and bolded, it gives the feeling that it does not have to be brought up to the federal level, just leave it to the state level, where they do not have amend the constitution, just have the states decide if they want to use the popular vote. Sulbaran 4 In comparison, the two pieces of advertisement used by the NPV both possess at least more than one rhetorical appeal. They both use them correctly in trying to persuade their audience to support the NPV. However, the video utilizes the appeals in a way that it becomes more persuasive and effective than the picture. The video uses the rhetorical appeals to explain the proposition, and has a main appeal being kairos and uses the other three to support kairos and the main theme of passing the proposition. Picture 1 in the other hand, uses only 2 rhetorical appeals, but even though they are used successfully, they do not surpass the video. The reason behind this is due to the fact that Picture 1 bases their idea on the date that the picture went public. As explained earlier, Picture 1 was posted the day on where the Electoral College members meet and vote. They based both of their rhetorical appeals, kairos and pathos, based on the date. This means that if an audience that does not know the relevance of the date of publication observes the picture, then the significance of the picture, and the appeals used lose their value. Taken out of context to try to persuade a person that sees the image for the first time in any other date, the picture will not work because the audience will have to know general knowledge before understanding the meaning of the picture. The video, however, does not need a date to hold its relevance. The video has a connection between all of the rhetorical appeals in it, and they all support kairos, the main appeal for the video. The purpose of kairos is to get the audience to support the NPV. Because of this, the video does not depend on the audience having previous knowledge, making the appeals work to the max of their capacity and being able to make the video more persuasive. The video is more successful because it can stand on its own and it is more persuasive because of the connections made between appeals and theme of the video. Sulbaran 5 Rhetorical appeals have their main purpose to help persuade an audience, and follow what the persuader is trying to explain. Because of the rhetorical appeals application in persuasion, it is present in many debatable topics. An example of the topics is the Electoral College. The NPV is an organization that supports the idea of updating the Electoral College. To try to persuade the public to support them, the NPV uses a campaign on videos and images full of rhetorical appeals. One of the videos is the one mentioned in the paper, on where the video possesses ethos, logos, pathos, and Kairos, on where they support the idea of what the NPV proposition is, how close they are on reaching this goal, and what the audience should do to get to that goal. The picture mentioned has the appeals of Kairos and pathos. It uses Kairos combined with the time of publication to try to prompt its audience to write to their legislators. They both use their appeals correctly and get the point across on why it is the right time to support the NPV.
