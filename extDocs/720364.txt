Jackson 1 Julius Jackson Sara Roth Enc 1101 4/5/2017 Redlining Redlining refers to a practice that the United States of housing market inflicted on its citizens during the 20 th century. The practice involved the evaluation of ethnic genome to determine where such individual could reside. It was enforced by realtors, banks, and the extent to which the government is unknown. Realtors would not inform their clients of all the available real-estate in an area regardless of the clients credentials, and the banks would not approve mortgage loans to clients regardless of their credentials. Race was the central component that would determine how an individual would be treated. When analyzing this practice through contemporary ethical standards the practice appears hideous, but one must realize that this treatment of minorities was a norm for American society in the early 20 th century. The practice likely had its largest impact during the Great Migration, which is when large sums of the black population began to migrate out of the south in search for job during the boom of the industrial age. The policy would continue to be used in the housing market until the radical change that happened along with the civil rights movement. The American Supreme Court began to establish laws to protect its citizens from such discrimination. Laws such as Community reinvestment act would be setup to with the focus of trying to reinvest back into all ethnic communities. This paper will analyze how this practice used a century ago still effects America today and argue how some components of redlining are still visible in housing market.
