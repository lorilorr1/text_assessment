Blackmer 1 Student Professor Thornton ENC 1102 5 March 2017 Solarcity and BP Both Want the Best for the Environment In world, most of our electricity comes directly from the process of burning fossil fuels. Companies like BP believe burning fossil fuels is the best form of electricity. BP provides their with fuel for transportation, energy for heat and light, lubricants to keep engines moving, and the petrochemicals (BP at a Glance). BP seeks to provide fuel to their customers for energy, they believe using and burning fossil fuels is the best choice in obtaining energy due to its availability and reliability. On the other hand, companies like SolarCity believe solar energy is the best form of electricity. SolarCity provides clean energy that is to homeowners, businesses, schools, non-profits and government organizations at a lower cost than they pay for energy generated by burning fossil (Learn More About SolarCity). SolarCity seeks to minimize their environmental footprint and provide cleaner energy by selling solar panels to their customers, they believe this is necessary to keep the planet healthy and prosperous. While SolarCity seeks to give their customers alternative sources of energy through solar panels, which effectively helps preserve nature, BP provides their customers energy through the process of burning fossil fuels, which negatively effects nature, but even with these differences, both companies seek to reduce their emissions. BP aims to provide their customers with energy through the process of burning fossil fuels. This is the complete opposite of plan of providing energy through solar panels. BP specifically choose to provide energy that way because it is more affordable. Along with Blackmer 2 being fairly cheap, unlike solar panels, oil has a very high energy density, this vehicles go further on less weight and volume of fuel than alternatives. Also, liquid form makes it easy to move around, globally and (Energy Outlook). Because BP mainly seeks to provide their customers with the most affordable and available resource, they stay away from providing solar energy. This brings fourth the main reason BP cannot make a compromise with SolarCity. Likewise, SolarCity has been unable to create a compromise with BP. SolarCity wants to provide their customers with cheap, clean energy. They are constantly concerned with the wellness of the environment as well as providing a cheap source of energy. By using solar panels, they can fulfill both of those concerns in an effective manner. By using solar panels, SolarCity allows their customers to reduce the amount of emissions they make, reducing gas emissions will also provide benefits to natural systems by reducing the magnitude of climate change impacts to which they need to (Adaramola 49). By burning fossil fuels, there are a lot of emissions negatively affecting our ecosystem, but using solar energy does not give off emissions. This is why SolarCity is an incompatible company to BP. With BP and SolarCity having two completely different ways of providing energy, they both are concerned about the environment as well as providing affordable, reliable energy to their customers. Although BP deals with burning fossil fuels, they are actually concerned with the environment, believes global action on climate change is needed. a complex issue and all aspects of the debate should be considered in their (The Climate Challenge). With BP actively noticing the negativity involved in the climate change, they can possible help resolve the issue by teaming with a company like SolarCity. On the other hand, SolarCity, much like BP, wants to provide affordable energy, but solar panels very cheap compared to Blackmer 3 fossil fuels. In the end both need to provide these things to their customers to stay alive and relevant, if they work together they can do this. A collaboration between BP and SolarCity could successfully help both companies grow while providing clean, affordable, and reliable energy. If BP were to try and decrease the amount of emissions they give off by burning fossil fuels, and at the same time, SolarCity were to be open to using some sort of energy from fuel, they could create a compromise. This compromise could be the idea of SolarCity offering a type of that uses both solar energy and energy from fossil fuels to power a house. They could use solar energy only for the day time, and at night the house would run solely on fossil fuel energy. There would also use solar energy in a case of power outage so the house would always have power. SolarCity already offers plenty of packages based on the size of house or business, so this could be completely viable. In the past and currently, this compromise has worked out tremendously. Numerous vehicles on the road everyday are powered by hybrid technology. Hybrid vehicles use both electric and internal combustion engines in order to be powered by both gasoline and batteries. Because they are using less gasoline, they produce less carbon emissions than gasoline-only vehicles, this helps conserve the amount of available fossil fuels as well as lower air pollution (Hybrid Vehicles). This compromise effectively provides consumers a vehicle that is environmentally friendly and reliable. It also works great because it gives business to both solar energy/battery companies and fossil fuel companies. A compromise between SolarCity and BP is completely feasible. It has already been done before with hybrid cars, so they should definitely be able to do it. Using similar technologies, they can create a system that benefits both companies. Since houses are typically already hooked up to a powerline, they just need the simple addition of a solar energy system. Once the system is Blackmer 4 placed, the consumer needs to be able to easily change which power source the house is running on. Also a display that shows how much solar energy is available could be useful to determine which energy source to use. To make this compromise even more effective, BP can find a way to decrease the amount of carbon emissions that fuel produces. SolarCity could also try and find different, more affordable materials to produce their solar panels with. Making the solar panels cheaper will help bring in more customers. Likewise, if fossil fuels gave off less emissions, people concerned about the environment might use fuel more often. This compromise can work tremendously if done right. Putting solar panels onto a house can be done easily by the company that sells them, but people often stray away due to the price of the unit. If SolarCity can produce cheaper solar panels, people will be more open to this compromise. With the house already having available energy, solar panels will help decrease the amount of energy from fossil fuels used, but not totally. This will give business to both BP and SolarCity. The system will help reduce the amount of emissions given off by the customer while still having readably available energy at all times, even through a power outage. The energy bills will also be noticeably cheaper, but they do have to pay a sum of money initially. Offering a financing option to the system will also attract buyers. They already pay for monthly electricity bills, adding the price of the solar panels while decreasing the price of the actual bill could become some sort of equilibrium. Both BP and SolarCity want to provide their customers with cheap, reliable energy. SolarCity seeks to do this by using solar energy, which helps lower emissions, and BP seeks to do this by burning fossil fuels, which creates emissions. By integrating a system that uses both solar energy and energy from burning fossil fuels into a house, similar to a hybrid car, both companies can continue to provide cheap, reliable energy while, at the same time, lowering the Blackmer 5 amount of emissions the world creates.
