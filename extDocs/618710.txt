Langs 1 Chase Langs Dennis Composition II 1/29/17 The EPA and NHRA, where is the compromise? One of the biggest contributors to global warming is the amount of CO2 from the creation and operation of motor vehicles. It is a proven fact that automobiles have had an effect on the environment for the worse. From the mining processes to get the materials, the billowing clouds of smoke coming from the factories where the vehicles are made, and the topic we are focusing on today the cars themselves, everything about this industry has increased CO2 emissions worldwide. Each time a vehicle is running it puts out an average of 122.1 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer, 197.9 grams per mile. (Gov.uk) With over one billion registered cars (and counting) driving around each year (Caradvice), that is a lot of CO2 floating into the atmosphere. As with most issues, we have two stakeholders with opposing views the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). While the NHRA believes in providing a safe place for competitors to race as well as the modification of cars, the EPA wants to bring this to a stop. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed a regulation to prohibit conversion of vehicles originally designed for on-road use into (Sema). So where can we find a happy medium? I propose that these two stakeholders meet in the middle and do as California has done pass stricter emission tests on street vehicles nationwide. That way if someone wants to modify their vehicle, they need to do it in such a way that it does not hurt the environment more than any other vehicle on the street. Some ways this can be done are the use of Lighter materials, cold air intakes, and turbocharged engines. It is a simple concept, less vehicle weight means the engine does not have to work as hard, resulting in better gas mileage and less emissions. The use of aluminum in non-structural parts of vehicles and carbon fiber throughout would achieve this. Ford Motor company has already put two of these into action with their newer F150 truck line. By using aluminum body frames and smaller turbocharged engines (Bloom) they have increased the efficiency of their trucks while staying in compliance with the EPA standards. With the new 2.7 liter Eco boost engine combined gas mileage has hit an all-time high of 22mpg compared to the old combined 17mpg from the year before (Greencar). Turbocharging has always been associated with making a car go faster, with its large use in Formula 1 racing it has come a long way. The way it works is as followed in the diagram below By forcing cooler, higher pressure air into the engine the engine can burn fuel more efficiently, this allows the engine to be downsized without the loss of power using less fuel compared to its big brother high displacement engines (turbocharge). On top of being more efficient with the smaller engines you have less weight in the car, making it work even less! Langs 2 By far the most expensive option of the three, carbon fiber is strong stiff fibrous material that is stronger than steel. It can be formed into everything from car doors, mirrors, wheels, or even the whole body as they do with supercars. However, the process is time consuming and expensive which is why it is reserved for the limited production cars such as Lamborghini and Ferrari. Until there is a way to mass produce carbon fiber cheaply and as quick as we make everyday road cars we will not see much of it no matter how efficient it is. In the diagram below you can see just how light it actually is. That is the body of a BMW I3 easily being picked up by two employees. If that was your standard automotive steel it would talk at least 4 men to pick it up. Langs 3 In conclusion, there are many ways that a car can go faster and still be efficient, they just take a little more planning and may be more expensive but the price to pay to protect ourselves from harmful emissions. Most people like change especially when it comes to traditionalist They consider a car unless it has a big displacement gas guzzling V8 under the hood, but times are changing, this the 1960s anymore, the world and people are in danger and it is time for a change. With this compromise I believe both sides can be generally happy, the EPA has less carbon emissions, and NHRA members are still able modify their cars, it may not be the traditional way but going fast is still going fast.
