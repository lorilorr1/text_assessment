Pawelec 1 Jakub Pawelec Ms. Tisdale ENC 1101 16 Mar 2017 Do Smartphones Help or Hinder Productivity? Smartphones have been considered useful tools due to their many capabilities ranging from GPS navigation to online to-do lists that can be synchronized with other devices. Many people think that smartphones help improve their productivity while others think that they hurt productivity. Between 2009-2014 several studies have been conducted to determine the effect of smartphone use on productivity in the workplace. During that time period the academic conversation about smartphones and productivity has not changed because the methodology of these studies, the context of these studies, and the results of these studies all changed. While these studies have been conducted from 2009 to 2014 they have all been carried out in a very similar fashion through the use of surveys. From 2009 to 2014 multiple studies used the methodology of surveys to analyze the effect smartphones have on productivity. Ahmad and study of IBM employees conducted in 2009 had over 400 participants (48) while Bertschek and study from 2014 featured the ZEW survey of manufacturing and business-related services firms that are located in Germany about 4400 firms were interviewed particularly about their ICT [information and communications (891). The authors all made efforts to ensure that their surveys had enough participants to reflect a random sample for accurate results. Kalkbrenner and study from 2011 for example polled people employed in both Pawelec 2 the private and government sectors. It also featured a fairly even age distribution (3). All of these studies were published in peer reviewed journals and therefore verified by experts to ensure their academic quality. Multiple studies from 2009 to 2014 examined the effects smartphones have on productivity in the context of the workplace. One of the studies also examined how smartphones affected productivity in their personal life but primarily focused on the effects on productivity in work life (Kalkbrenner 3). Bertschek and study focused on the productivity of German businesses on a national level (889). Ahmad and Orton meanwhile studied the productivity of employees at one large company, IBM (47). Another study from 2012 focus on any specific businesses but still focused on the effects smartphones had on the workplace productivity of employees as well as the effect on work-to-life conflict (Yun 121). While each of these studies had a slightly different focus they all primarily researched the effects smartphones had on productivity in the context of the workplace. Because of these factors, the context of these studies changed from 2009 to 2014. The results of several studies from 2009 to 2014 show that smartphones do indeed increase productivity. Ahmad and study of IBM employees found that smartphones helped increase communication and collaboration between employees which allowed for more insight and expertise when completing tasks (50). This study also found that smartphones were favored by employees in the field due their ability to access needed information quickly (49). Bertschek and study of German businesses found that smartphone use is positively related with a labor productivity (893). Kalkbrenner and study of smartphone users found that the majority of respondents felt that smartphones increased their productivity (7). The study conducted by Yun, Kettinger, and Lee also found that smartphones Pawelec 3 increase productivity, especially when smartphones are configured to focus on productivity tools rather than increasing flexibility in work hours and locations (145). These studies all found that smartphones do indeed increase the productivity of those who use them. Due to these findings, the results of these studies changed from 2009 to 2014. Multiple studies conducted from 2009 to 2014 reflect that the academic conversation about smartphones and their effect on productivity changed. During this time period the methodology of the studies change as they were all conducted through surveys. The context of these studies change either because these studies all primarily focused on the effect of smartphones in the context of the workplace. These studies also had the same results which indicated that smartphones do increase the productivity of their users. Smartphones allow for increased productivity in a work setting due to their many capabilities such as easily communicating with other employees (Ahmad 49) and checking work email outside of the office (Yun 121). Because of the benefits that smartphones provide to the workplace through these studies the smartphone will continue to be an important tool for the workplace in the future.
