Rothkopf 1 Mac Rothkopf Project 2 Intermediate Draft Kristen Rouisse 2/26/17 There are an abundant of diseases or illness and many of them still do not have a cure. My stakeholder, The Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies, also known as (MAPS), has the resources and determination to continue to study ways no other company or scientist will look for to one day find a cure for these syndromes. Being a non-profit organization, comes with many pros and cons such as being under the radar to not having enough capital from their stakeholders because they are a small organization. Being that as it may, they do have pose a real influence in many different fields of their work. MAPS mission statement states that they develop treatment for people who benefit from the use of some psychedelics but the main object being marijuana. MAPS is truly invested with a heavy stake being that of advocating the use of marijuana for known medical reasons and study purposes only. It is evident to see with both images that this non-profit organization advocates for the use of marijuana for research and medical purposes only. The first image represents numerous rhetorical appeals being as it can be related to with such ease. Showing a big strong military member looking out into the abyss, his facial expression tells a lot about the image by itself. From the looks of his services it is evident to see he is going through severe post dramatic stress. One of the four rhetorical appeals ethos which is an appeal to credibility can be represented in this image by the facts they include in this image. Rothkopf 2 On top of the facts about military veterans and their relationship to stress after they are relieved of their duties, but it also claims to come in for a study evaluating the effects of some drugs marijuana being one of them. On top of that another rhetorical appeal pathos which is an appeal to emotion is greatly represented in this image. This person is son, brother, possible father and to see veterans go through such hard times after they had contributed their life to serve the country is an extreme burden. Logos being an appeal to logic and reasoning, the person in the image is just standing there. He knows he has to find help, just stand there go do something about this, get assistance to find ways to prevent and cure. Finally, Kairos an appeal to timeliness, the image itself is persuading these people to stand up and do something regarding this certain stress disorder. The character is looking into his future essentially, will he every grow up to be okay and be involved in such things like seeing your son and daughter grow up. This image is definitely pointed to an audience with family members who have served and are serving this country. Health should be top priority and it is showing an exclamation point to do something about it. The next image however, being as it is just words and not anything real, can be seen as even more influential and accomplish its purpose. Ethos in this specific image is appealing toward morals, by which words were chosen to use. Some of the words include risk, fear, PTSD, anxiety, trauma, and much more intense words. The image definitely appeals to pathos also known as emotion by, how individuals relate to each word differently from experience or education. I will say the appeal to logos could be improved tremendously other than the fact that we obviously want any of these negative things to happen to us so it puts a great fear in the audience. The audience is reaching out to all ages, everyone going through one of these disorders or anyone seeing another live their life with a minor handicap. An appeal to timeliness Kairos is Rothkopf 3 also sort of briefly brushed over with no examples or ways to further connect the audience to the image. There are in-fact a few rhetorical fallacies which can be erased if the author had brought us another eye opener into this image, whether it be an action or just someone there that we can further relate with. The overall goal from most of my images revolve around someone is in pain and this organization is willing to help. Both images want the audience to feel scared that there is nothing to treat what they have, trying to make the audience feel lost. These images are trying to counter that, saying we have what you need to get better. Both images are realistic and can be interpreted and viewed in many different ways. What separated both images was the first one had specific questions to wrap your head around this idea for example are you a U.S. military veteran, Have you ever experienced traumatic stress? These images both strengthen the argument the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies addresses which is advocating the use of these drugs specifically marijuana to help and treat people with these disorders. In conclusion the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, (MAPS) is a non-profit organization with truly only one goal which is to help these people in need. They have researched many different drugs and substances to try and find a cure to these conditions. (MAPS) being a pond in this big war against drugs, is looking for new ways to expand their ideologies for the advancement of this field. Through these images which back up what they are preaching, all leads back to one idea. MAPS is trying to have a scientific breakthrough to finally aid all these individuals which have gone through and are currently going through today. It is evident to see with both images that this non-profit organization advocates for the use of marijuana for research and medical purposes only.
