Nicole Zamorano Professor Pequette English Composition 1 January 29, 2017 The Arts in Schools Most schools require that a student completes a fine arts course upon graduating high school rather it be theatre , chorus , painting, creative writing, or any other subject the school sees as a fine art . But , what would happen if we eliminate the fine arts in schools or not make it part of the graduating requirements ? Studies have shown that participating in fine arts does have a positive effect on the students learning development, but at what cost? There are constant debates on whether states should stop funding these programs in schools and put that money towards other things for the students. Under current federal law , the arts are considered a part of a well-rounded education , which means they receive as much funding as reading , math , science and other subjects. Some may argue that that is ridiculous and that other school departments need more funding, like the athletic department .Most often , the same individuals who propose terminating funding to the arts are the same individual who suggest giving the athletic programs more funding .It seems to be a constant fight between who receives more funding but the real question is : is it worth keeping the arts in schools?

The role of arts participation in academic and nonacademic outcomes: A longitudinal study of school, home, and community  Nicole Zamorano Professor Pequette English Composition 1 January 29, 2017 Journal of Educational Psychology 105.3 (2013): 709-27. Web. According to the journal The Role of Arts Participation in Academic and Nonacademic Outcomes: A Longitudinal Study of School, Home, and Community Factors , the arts have always faced issues when it comes to funding and getting space in schools. They conducted a study and found that students who participate in theatre and music are engaged in academics more than those students who are not . The study also concluded that the arts also help with identity-related development and is helpful for self-esteem. The arts may also have something to do with self-determination. This journal basically discussed the benefits that the arts have on the young minds of school kids. This relates directly with the topic because if we were to not have the arts in schools anymore, kids may not get the same development as they would with the programs. This journal and similar studies should be thought of when the time comes to make a decision on whether to keep the arts in schools or if the funding should be used for a different department . This journal was written in 2013 and was a part of the Journal of Educational Psychology and was peer reviewed. Miksza, Peter. Arts Education Advocacy: The Relative Effects of School-Level Influences on Nicole Zamorano Professor Pequette English Composition 1 January 29, 2017 Resources for Arts  Arts Education Policy Review 114.1 (2013): 25-32. Web. In the article Arts Education Advocacy: The Relative Effects of School-Level Influences on Resources for Arts Education, several were written discussing the effects of the arts on students . The one that particularly stood out was the No Child Left Behind and Fine Arts Classes study . In this article , the No Child Left behind Act ( an act of congress which brought back the Elementary and Secondary Education Act which helps those students who are at a disadvantage compared to the rest and authorized several federal funding programs one of which sent funding to the arts) was discussed along with its disadvantages with scheduling and funding . The main point was that it iis very difficult to find the funding and to fit the arts into a students already busy schedules. Compared to the previous journal , this one serves as a counter argument discussing the disadvantages of keeping the arts in schools. This journal was also written in 2013 , but the article discussing the No Child Left Behind Act was written in 201rhgr0 before Obama took over the presidency and replaced it with the Every Student Succeeds Act in 2015. The journal was also peer reviewed. Nicole Zamorano Professor Pequette English Composition 1 January 29, 2017 David Sudmalis. Student, home, and school socio-demographic factors: links to school, home,and community arts  The Australian Educational Researcher 43.2 (2016): 221-44. Web. In this study , it was discovered that the role the student plays at home is directly correlated with their participation in the arts. The more the student is involved in home , school and their community , the more likely they are to be participation in the arts. It was also discovered that the caregiver career and education also affected their participation in the arts. This relates directly with the topic because this article is stated there is a direct relationship with the students involvement in their homes and community with their participation in the arts. If we were to cut funding for the arts program , just imagine the decline of the student participation be around the community. The arts seems to be a form of motivation to get students involved. Russell-Bowie, Deirdre. An Ode to Joy or the Sounds of Silence? An Exploration of Arts Education Policy in Australian Primary  Arts Education Policy Review 112.4 Nicole Zamorano Professor Pequette English Composition 1 January 29, 2017 (2011): 163-73. Web. This article is different than most because instead of discussing the benefits of the arts , it discusses how the arts have not had much influence on the lives of Australian children. The article states how the Australian school system has had a lot of policies that have done nothing to benefit the art programs in schools , and instead of having the expected negative effect on the students , they seem indifferent. This article is vital to the topic because it serves as a counter argument. Most articles would fight the idea of removing the arts programs in school , while this study showed how the students seemed unchanged without a good art program in school. This is a very important finding because it could possibly mean that we could move funding to programs like school athletics programs which have been proven to have a positive outcome on the students instead of funding a program that seems to not be effecting the students in anyway.
