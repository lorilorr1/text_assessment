Viens 1 Evelyne Viens Professor Emil Smith Composition 1 April 9, 2017 Female Athletes Are Treated Different Than Male Athletes In the 2000s, some people started to talk about total equality between women and men in salary, no discrimination and equal opportunities. Women have worked hard to improve their rights over the last few decades. Improvements have been made in multiple aspects of life. However, some major instances of discrimination are still present between both genders in sports. Female and male athletes are not treated the same way in terms of general mentality, representation in media, and salary. The first area to address would be the discriminating mentality of society that affects the participation of women in sports. The common thought throughout society is that men are better than women and deserve more which is causing a lot of problems for sports. In a study, researchers showed that women athletes have fewer chances to receive a scholarship than male athletes in the Canadian university system. Moreover, the teams receive more promotion for their team and a greater share of operating budgets even though the source does not specify the average difference in budget (Hoeber, 2006). Every athlete in high school should have the same opportunities to play in college and receive financial help; it is not a question about who is bringing more money to the school but a question of are universities providing equal opportunities to both genders. Furthermore, between high school and college, the problem still can be observed because of the scholarship issue. According to the Sports Foundation, have 1.3 million fewer opportunities to play high school sports than do boys and there are 12 million 3 rd through- Viens 2 12 th - grade boys playing sports while only 8 million girls do (Learn, 2014). Even with all the acts and movements for equality like Title IX and feminism, even as recent as 2014, young females still do not have enough chance to become involved in sports. Thus, as shown in the table Frequent Physical girls and boys do not participate in the same sports. The table shows that girls are more likely to do dancing, swimming and basketball; boys are more likely to do basketball, football and soccer (Learn, 2014). Girls cannot participate in the same sports as boys due to societal double-standards. Boys can do dance and swimming, but girls cannot play football or baseball, it is illogical in the society. The discriminating mentality affects participation in sports for women and also affects how these female athletes are represented in media. The huge lack of representation of female athletes in the media results in the continuity of discrimination between both genders. It is a fact that any spectators that want to watch sports on TV have more chance to catch a teams playing than a team. According to a study done by Good (2015), 2014, LA-based network affiliates devoted only 3.2 percent of airtime to sports, down from 5 percent in Additionally, the study shows that SportsCenter gave only 2% of their TV time to sports and 81.6% of this time is focused on basketball. Over the last nearly two decades, the representation has not evolved in television. It is a huge problem, considering all the rules that were established, such as Title IX, the lack of media representation is still a disaster for the evolution of the sports. Though, at some point the media representation was equal when Cunningham notes a unique situation between and tennis coverage in a University. He concluded that thinks that team receive more coverage than team, this scientific research shows the (Cunningham, 2003). However, this is only one example for one sport that did not last a long time. Further, in 2003, the Internet popularity started to grow. The coverage of men and women sports Viens 3 were equal. However, the motive of representing female athletes on TV can be discriminatory in the sense that spectators will only watch for the physical appeal of the player (Dick and Kellers, 2006). In 2000, Anna Kournikova was ranked #8 in WTA ranking and she has never won a single tennis tournament in her career, but men watched her on TV. She was the sex symbol of tennis and she was succeeding because of her appearance and not her performance on the court. This situation did not last a very long time nor did not fix longer problem as salary. The less representation in media brings salary deficits for female athletes. Some people still think that male athletes deserve to be treated better than females because they produce a bigger business cycle. It is common sense to observe that teams have a bigger audience and more coverage. Although, the biggest issue between male and female athletes is the noticeable wage gap. The problem is that sometimes female athletes perform better than the males and the salary discrimination is still present. For example, U.S. Soccer published statistics that proved the fiftieth player on the team receives $246,238 per year, but at the same rank, the player received $25,516 (Das, 2016). Even the U.S. soccer team is the top most ranking team in the world, it still receives less money than the U.S. team that is ranked 30 th in the world. Even though the team makes it to the final World Cup, the team stopped in quarterfinal, the male athletes still receive the paycheck. The wage gap between these two teams are huge, even if the female athletes perform better. Moreover, this situation does not just happen in soccer, it happens in many sports. A legend like Serena Williams earns less money than the tennis player ranked number 1, even if both of them are dominating their sport. According a study by Flake, Dufur, and Moore (2013), 1 identifies the size of the gap in 2009 prize money: on average, females earned .235 logged dollars (p < .05) less than their male counterparts during the 2009 Even if male and female athletes are Viens 4 doing the same sport, the salary difference is still considerable between both genders. The wage gap is the biggest problem in the professional teams today. The inequality between female and male athletes are still present in sports. The discriminating mentality from the society, the lack of representation in media and the huge wage gap illustrate the unequal treatment of female athletes. A few decades later from the establishment of Title IX and feminism, the difference in benefits received by female and male athletes is still huge. To find a way to achieve equality between both genders in sports, all of society will need to participate by stopping discrimination against female athletes, encouraging the representation of teams on TV, and finally equalizing salary.
