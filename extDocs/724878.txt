Josh McGowan Ms. Ricketts ENC 1101 9 April 2017 The Evolutionary Controversy Evolution is the scientific theory of how life changes over time. Scientists explain evolution through certain processes, such as natural selection and genetic mutation. Just as a concept, it has been in conflict with the ideals and beliefs of people since its introduction to the world. Throughout the years, research into evolution has ironically strengthened the arguments both supporting its legitimacy and the arguments attempting to dismiss it. For example, scientists see the fossil record as a continuous source of evidence that species have evolved over time while those in opposition dismiss the fossil record because its telling of evolutionary history is incomplete. The religious find the notion that we are closely related to apes to be insulting and preposterous while scientists say the proof lies in our genetics. The controversy mostly comes from how these two vastly different concepts converge into the world of politics. The scientific concept of evolution and the religious beliefs of a predominately Christian society are morphed into political movements (Caiazza 105). The conflict is unavoidable, however, as the theory is viewed by many to be essential to science education. The fundamental flaw is that political movements have an agenda and have already decided what the end goal of a debate should be. Science and religion have been butting heads even before evolution was the center of it. Although evolution is a subject of political controversy and is difficult to comprehend at times, it is critical in understanding biology and biological diversity. Teaching the theory is a key piece of science education. Evolution became a controversial topic after Charles Darwin popularized the idea with his publication of The Origin Species. It was an incredible scientific breakthrough; Darwin had done for biology what Newton did for physics, explaining how the mechanisms that drive the natural world operate (Caiazza 105). The ideas expressed by Darwin, however, were not accepted by the Christian rule he lived under. A clash of science and religion ensued. Caizza wrote about how man and ape being directly related was viewed as demeaning and insulting, positing that the Earth is more than a few thousand years old was in direct conflict with the Bible, and the concept of Social Darwinism caused an uproar (110). Social Darwinism applies the idea of natural selection (survival of the fittest) to a social context, saying that the weaker members of society essentially need to be weeded out (Caiazza 110). The topic was irrelevant, however, as it was a philosophical perspective, and scientific arguments can be make against it. Species succeed the most when individuals within them work together. Scientific observation became mute, though, as evolution sparked a debate regarding free speech. Those who accepted research and theories were basically silenced by the harsh rule of England (Caiazza 111). Evolution was put into the center of a political debate, and the scientific aspect of it became lost on most people. Darwin only tried to improve the world with new knowledge of how life progresses over time, and it ended up as an excuse for two opposing sides to try to enforce a political and social agenda. In the modern day, there has been disputes over whether evolution should be taught in public schools. It is argued by some that schools should teach intelligent design alongside evolution as another possibility. Intelligent design is the idea that the Earth was created directly by God a few thousand years ago. According to Zigler, the idea of teaching this in a science class is preposterous, because overwhelming majority of scientists and science educators maintain that from a scientific perspective the theory of not intelligent a strong epistemic foundation If something has no foundation in science, then it has no place in a science curriculum. Evolution is a requirement for public schooling. Without it, everything we know about how life progressed, the mechanisms behind reproduction and genetics, and the balance of biological diversity has no foundation. As previously stated, there is no debate among scientists on if evolution is happening, but only the specifics of how it happened and how it will continue. Different teaching methods are proposed in an article by Paul Thagard and Scott Findlay. They go as follows: detachment (avoiding religion/intelligent design altogether), confrontation (attempting to disprove intelligent design), and theistic evolution (the idea that God guides the process of evolution) (632). Detachment is the only realistic option here. People are very passionate about their religious beliefs, so confrontation only serves to make the more religiously inclined feel targeted and consequently turned off from science. Theistic evolution is something religious people can use to stay true to their beliefs while also pursuing science education, but to teach it as if it is a known fact would simply be dishonest. Evolution belongs in public education and should simply be presented to students and those students will have their own opinions about what they learned. It has been very apparent that all controversies behind the theory of evolution tie back to religion. Can science and religion coexist? Even back around the time Origin of Species was still relatively new, a Christian Harvard professor by the name of Asa Gray cited his work to help explain the distribution of plant life across North America (Caiazza 109). One of the big controversies at the time dealt with man evolving from ape, but is the notion really so insulting? Evolution acknowledges humans as superior to every other animal. Our complex brains have allowed for major innovations in medicine, infrastructure, architecture, art, and everything else. Where we came from invalidate where we ended up. Religion and science are both unfit to disprove each other. Most disputes even involve evolution, but the origin of the universe, which is something nobody fully understands. Religion is something that is mainly philosophical, spreading ideas about how people ought to behave to achieve peace of mind, while science is our attempts to explain things that we see and experience through research and observation. Science and religion inherently opposing forces, but different aspects of our lives that only come into conflict through politics. Evolution, at this point in time, should not be a controversial topic. impact on how we understand the world is undeniable at this point in time. Political and social issues that involve the evolution are important to discuss, but they take away from the credibility. It belongs in our public school science curriculum, and should be taught in a way that it directly challenge personal beliefs. Discussions regarding religion and science can be had, but nobody should have an expectation of disproving each other, but rather just have an exchange of different ideas and information. Evolution is one of, if not the most important aspect of science. Modern biology revolves around it and it is critical in understanding the way the world works.
