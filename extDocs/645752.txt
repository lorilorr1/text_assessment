Student 1 Student Instructor Lewis ENC 1102 29 January 2017 WC: 1097 Project 1 Intermediate Draft As fossil fuels become scarce, alternative sources for energy will become a necessary tool to power the country. Solar energy is one of the fastest growing sources of renewable energy used in the United States. According to SolarPowerRocks, forty minutes enough solar energy reaches the surface to power the world for a (SolarPowerRock 2016). Two men, Dan Hahn and Dave Llorens created the organization, Solarpowerrocks, in hopes to give homeowners, business owners and legislators a way to research the investment of solar energy and show how it works economically. SolarPowerRocks is a company that advocates for use of solar energy by educating the public about the benefits, costs and providing steps into using this resource. It strives to show the public that solar energy can be an affordable and accessible energy resource and eliminate common myths. SolarPowerRocks provides infographics to appeal to the general public with research on solar power. It uses rhetorical appeals like ethos, pathos, and kairos to persuade viewers to invest time and money into the future of solar power. The first infographic is a bar graph demonstrating the profit the consumer would make over the years from 2017 to 2041. In the left hand corner it mentions the greatest solar loan available to Florida, which is a 5kw system. In the right hand corner, it gives four steps to make the transformation into being a solar panel user. Thus showing how simple it is to get into the process of using solar energy. It shows the first fifteen years with loan payments including the Student 2 federal tax credit. Over the course of the sixteenth year and twenty-fifth year, it shows the consistent and growing profit that will be gained through the investment. According to Rhetorical Appeals, appeals to logic and (Hoffman & Wiggs 27). Logos is a rhetorical appeal used in both infographics. The bar graph data creates statistics that appeal to logic that it benefits the consumer economically. If the viewer invests into this specific alternative energy, they can create profit for years to come and receive a federal tax credit within the first year. According to Rhetorical appeals, as the type of persuasion that pertains to the right place and the right (Hoffman & Wiggs 28). The bar graph shows the progression of profit giving the consumer a goal. Ideally, the consumer will feel pressure to invest because starting now means a bigger profit in the future. The graph starts in 2017 and the viewer does not know how the information will be altered if started next year. According to Rhetorical Appeals, appeal to pathos is an appeal to (Hoffman & Wiggs 39). Pathos is used in this infographic with the list of steps to get solar power. Specifically, the fourth and last step demonstrates that by saying the consumer will save money and smile after you the consumer starts using solar power. Saving money and smiling insinuates that the consumer will be happy just by using solar energy. The symbol of SolarPowerRocks on the bottom of this image uses a happy hand symbol that says that highlights how the company brings happiness to others. The visual cues in the first infographic used are the report card template, and icons. The circle contains all of the report card grades with colors, and highlighted grades for each category. Each grade is color coated depending on the letter each item received. Yellow is used to show a mediocre grade of Red is to show an unsatisfactory grade of a or Green is to show above satisfactory grade of an or The icon of the company make the concept seem fun and lighthearted with the added hand signal. Overall, the colors help show you Student 3 the strongpoints and low points of having solar power in Florida. The infographic are all earthy tones therefore it reinforces the concept of the environment being used in this investment. The second infographic is in a report card format. It uses colors and letter grades to evaluate policies, investment return, loan payback time and incentives in using solar energy in Florida. With each grades, it creates an overall grade of a for Florida. On the left hand side, it ranks Florida against the other states for solar power grades and reveals its ranking as the twenty-sixth state. It references specific policies like the RPS law, Solar CarveOut and incentives like rebates, tax exemptions to create grades. The categories create a pros and cons list for the viewer making it extremely easy to logically agree with making the investment into solar power. The categories bring the logos, the rhetorical appeal to life. In this specific infographic, time is a huge factor which brings Kairos into question. The report card is made for 2017 and not any other year. The consumer should take into account that any of the grades assigned to policies and incentives may be alter and change to a lower grade for the next year. Out of fear of data inaccuracy from this data, the consumer would assume that investment in the 2017 is the most beneficial year to start. Timeliness is also complemented by pathos. The second infographic uses pathos with the symbol. The symbol has the rock on hand signal as well on the right hand corner. The visual cues in the second infographic are the bar graph and the icons. The graph makes the data easy to understand and comprehend. The steps listed make the process seem more accessible to viewers. The icons are supposed to lighten the mood and make solar power seem like a fun, new and exciting thing to learn about. The image uses earthy colors, green and orange, to further advance its points about solar energy. Earthy colors help remind the viewer that they are helping the earth by deciding to use solar energy as opposed to non-renewables. Student 4 In conclusion, the rhetorical and visual appeals help persuade the viewer to believe in the investment. The primary visual message of the first infographic that the organization is trying to communicate is that although it will take a longer investment of time to reap the benefits of solar power, in the long run solar energy will provide users with a larger, more consistent profit. The primary visual message of the second infographic illustrates that Florida is one of the better states to obtain and best utilize solar power in As well as the benefits and disadvantages of getting solar power in Florida.
