Harris 1 Brittany Harris Professor Bianca Hernandez English 1102 29 January 2017 Lowering the Minimum Age to Drink Alcohol Considering the numerous laws that exist in this society, it seems as if the United States views the age of 18 as a rite of passage and initiation for most people because by that age they will be able to make mature and informed decisions for themselves. However, since the National Minimum Drinking Age Act was implemented in 1984, drinking alcohol has not been a decision that 18 years olds are able to make (Miller et al. 1). Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) is an organization that has built their platform based solely upon this Act in which they believe when a person reaches the age of 21 they are entitled to make their own decision on whether they would like to drink alcohol or not (Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) . However, during the people were allowed to drink alcohol at the age of 18(Miller et al. 1). Choose Responsibility is an organization that supports lowering the minimum drinking age back down to 18 like it once was before because by that age a person is considered a legal adult (Choose Responsibility). Lowering the minimum age to drink has been a controversial issue of discussion in our society which has caused organizations such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) and Choose Responsibility to develop and enter the conversation. While Mothers Against Drunk Driving(MADD) believes that maturity to drink alcohol starts at the age of 21, Choose Responsibility believes it should start at the age of 18 once adulthood emerges. Rather than maturity being defined by age, it should instead be measured from level of Harris 2 comprehension of alcohol consumption by obtaining an alcohol permit at the age of 19, which can be a viable compromise between the two organizations. Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) supports The Minimum Drinking Age Act in which they have integrated it as a part of their platform and mission. According to Mothers Against Drunk Driving, their mission is end drunk driving, help fight drugged driving, support the victims of these violent crimes and prevent underage . They discourage the fact that the age should be lowered to 18 for numerous of reasons. One reason includes the dangers that can occur from drunk driving. They believe that 18 year olds are not yet responsible or adult enough to conform to the rules of alcohol consumption, such as not drinking and driving. They have proved their theory by analyzing data in the where in 37 states people were allowed to drink alcohol at the age of 18. From this data and considering the amount of devastating cases that occurred frequently from drunk driving, The United States decided that this was not a great setting the age to drink alcohol to 21 (Miller et al. 1). The United States was not the only country to test drinking alcohol at the age of 18 and disappointedly failed. A study done in 2006, published by Addiction, reviewed the effects of New decision to legalize alcohol consumption to 18 year olds throughout the It concluded that  The lowering of the minimum purchase age may have led to an increase in drink-driving among the  (Huckle, Tasia., Pledger, Megan., and Casswell, Sally 60). Another reason MADD believes that the minimum age to drink be lowered to 18 is because 18 year olds are still growing physiologically and psychologically. For example, drinking alcohol affects the brain negatively (Mothers Against Drunk Driving). This also can be supported by a research article published in Neuroscience journal that concluded that when drinking alcohol as an adolescent, it disrupts the brain during development and alters the ability Harris 3 of their brain to respond to stressful events during adulthood (Allen et al. 60). Overall, Mothers Against Drunk Driving have mentioned a variety of points in which they were able to support on why they believe the minimum age to drink should stay at the age of 21. Once a person becomes the age of 18, they are automatically considered an adult. They are able to do things such as: obtain a driving license, vote, work full time, enlist in the army, and even buy cigarettes. Choose Responsibility is a nonprofit organization that recognizes the fact 18 years olds are young adults and should not be denied the decision to drink alcohol. Their mission is to revise current legislation regarding alcohol so that young adults can make mature decisions about alcohol themselves. (Choose Responsibilty). While MADD enforces the Minimum age to drink to stay 21, Choose Responsibility insist that it is actually causing more damage and it should be lowered to 18 (Choose Responsibility). John McCardy, founder of Choose Responsibility and also college professor, recognizes the negative effects that The Minimum Drinking Age Act has caused in the college community--a community that resides 18 - 20 year olds (McCardell). Many adults under the age to drink are consuming alcohol in an excessive and irresponsible manner. Ruth Eng, a professor of public health, offered her opinion based on research, and suggested  This is because drinking by these youth is seen as an enticing forbidden  a badge of rebellion against  and a symbol of (Eng Ruth 1). Another unintended consequence is the increasing rate of false identifications to prove they are of the age to drink alcohol, which has also become a felony (John McCardy). Considering the negative effects resulting from this act, keeping the minimum drinking age at 21 has not always effected our society positively. Choose Responsibility is an advocate for lowering the minimum age to drink and confronts the reality of alcohol that exist in young lives today (Choose Responsibility). Harris 4 The disagreement between the two organizations, Mothers Against Drunk Driving and Choose Responsibility, arises when deciding the age that ensures responsibility and maturity. Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) supports The Minimum Drinking Age Act and believes not only has it been a tremendous impact on our society, but on the young community as well. For example, it has decreased the rates of drunk driving (Phillips and Goldbas 3). Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) sole purpose is to protect the young community and to avoid any harm caused by drunk driving (Mothers Against Drunk Driving). This is why they insist on keeping the legal age to drink at 21 because by that age MADD feels as if people are mature enough to drink alcohol responsibly. Choose Responsibility want to lower the age to drink to 18 only because it would be a matter of fairness. They also take safety and responsibility into consideration when supporting their stance. For example, they disagree with the Minimum Age to Drink Act because they believe it is causing more harm than benefit to the young community. Choose name even implies that they want to promote responsibility, while helping young adults understand the reality of alcohol consumption in their lives. Both organizations agree that responsibility and maturity is essential before being able to drink alcohol. Since both organizations, Mothers Against Drunk Driving and Choose Responsibility supports maturity and responsibly before being able to drink alcohol, an age determine those attributes. Instead, an alcohol education course should be taken by 19 year olds to obtain a permit , which teachers a person aspects relating to drinking and the precautions that they should be take while consuming alcohol. The minimum age to drink should at least be lowered to 19 because it somewhat meets in the middle of 18 and 21. According to a research article entitled What works in school-based alcohol education: A systematic , it was that proven some Harris 5 alcohol educational programs such as, Project Alert (Australia) and All Stars(USA), has had a significant and positive effect on the young community on teaching them how to be more responsible (Lee et al.). It is true that some alcohol programs in the past, such as Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE), were ineffective in minimizing the alcohol risks that were taken by young adults (Harvey Seamus., McKay, Michael., and Sumnall Harry 4). However, United Kingdom has even started School Health and Alcohol Harm Reduction Project (SHAHRP) and it has been effective because of its ability to engage young adults, unlike other unsuccessful alcohol education programs (Lee et al.) Therefore, implementing a 40-hour alcohol education course in the guidelines to obtain an alcohol permit can ensure maturity and responsibility before drinking alcohol. However, people will not be allowed to obtain an alcohol permit until they reach the age of 19. Since the issue between the two organizations, Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) and Choose Responsibility, is the age of responsibility, obtaining a license through an alcohol education course can be a viable compromise.
