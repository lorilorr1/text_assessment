Atkins 1 Michael Atkins Kristen Rouisse ENC 1102 25 February 2017 NRA and the Rhetorical Appeal Being one of the most influential political lobbying groups, the National Rifle Association (NRA) plays a major role in securing gun rights and other rights protected within the 2 nd Amendment. With their motto being Right of the People to Keep and Bear Arms Shall Not Be the NRA not only looks to politicians, but to the American people as well. On top of lobbying to persuade politicians to vote and sway in support of the political agenda, the NRA also sees advertisements as a great way to inform the American citizens and as a way to potentially get voters to the booths in support of the cause. Two of the types of advertisements that the NRA use to promote their agenda are seen below. Although the most obvious and most common theme found in the advertisements is the feeling of defenselessness, the advertisements released to the public display have a unique ability to effectively implement all four elements of the rhetorical appeal and aim to change the opinion of the American people as well inspire supporters to vote. protecting 2 nd Amendment rights. One of the most popular and well-known organizations against gun control in America is the National Rifle Association. According to the NRA, the organization is started out seeking to form a location to practice marksmanship and support shooting sports, however, is now recognized today as a major political force and as foremost defender of Second Amendment (NRA). The NRA is one of the most influential lobbying groups in the Atkins 2 United States, spending over $3 million annually, allowing for the organization to persuade government officials to vote on laws which favor less restrictive gun control (Morse). The NRA executive vice president has vocally called for changes regarding particular gun laws, stating only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a (Overby). The NRA promotes the idea of properly carrying and shooting a weapon while protecting oneself from being a victim. Although the organization fights for gun rights and wishes to see a greater, less restrictive gun presence in the United States, the NRA is a large proponent of gun safety and education. The first NRA advertisement to be analyzed deals with the most recent Presidential election. From first glimpse in the center of the page, the advertisement reads let Hillary leave you (NRA). Being a primarily a conservative, republican organization, the NRA seeks to establish a dislike for Hillary by simply stating that she would remove guns from the American public, which is strictly against the agenda. This quote on the advertisement is an attempt to use Logos as the creator of the advertisement wants the attention to be on the message of voting against Hillary as well as an appeal to reason as it is attempting to persuade the audience that Hillary is anti-gun. The second rhetorical appeal that is distinctly seen in the first advertisement would be Ethos. In this advertisement, the NRA establishes itself as a credible organization by displaying their logo in a large and visually appealing location. As one looks at the picture from left to right, the logo is placed in a location to be seen as soon as one is done reading the quote. Also, in the logo itself you can see the year the organization was founded which further establishes itself due to the fact the NRA has been around since 1871. After further analysis, and taking a more in depth look at the picture, one may realize that an home had been broken into with room to speculate about a murder scene due to the fact the Atkins 3 rights of gun ownership have been taken away. To implement the rhetorical appeal of pathos, the advertisement makes an attempt to instill fear into the viewer; that this could happen to their home, their family or their own live. This ad allows for one to speculate what happened at the crime scene displayed and for imagination to run wild, hopefully in favor of the viewpoint that guns are vital for defending one selves and property. Although the first advertisement makes an attempt to implement kairos within, the attempt seems to fall short. One may feel the need to act now and either vote to keep gun rights or to go out and purchase protection for one selves or property, however this advertisement does not explicitly show an immediate call to action. Nor does this picture target a specific audience. One way the NRA could have improved on this advertisement would have been to display an opportunity help stop the potential removal of guns by Hillary Clinton by making this an advertisement supporting a political campaign which would have helped appeal to supporters of that campaign or to immediately convince individuals to vote for that nominee. The second advertisement also makes an immediate attempt to play with the fears. The first section to come into play is the quote law abiding American should be forced to face evil with empty (NRA). Not only is this portraying the message the NRA is trying to promote by using logos, but is also using the quote to establish pathos within the advertisement. In this very simplistic advertisement, the choice of words such as and create a great sense of emotion in the viewer. Simply stating, to establish fear, the quote portrays the feeling of a good guy facing evil without any means of defense, which would ultimately lead to dismay. Similar to the first advertisement, the NRA is able to establish ethos by showcasing its logo within the advertisement with a URL to a website to read more and sign up to support the cause which the NRA is trying to promote. Finally, the advertisement Atkins 4 establishes kairos by including a man into the advertisement. This could be seen as an attempt to draw in not only young men, but also African-American men who are more apt to support a more liberal organization rather than a more conservative organization, such as the NRA. Although, the rhetorical appeal of logos is present within the advertisement, there is a lack of internal consistency within. From the quote, one can see the message however, the rest of the advertisement lacks this message. There is nothing within this advertisement that showcases the idea of being defenseless which is opposite to the first advertisement that was analyzed. In order to adjust this, the advertisement could have been reworked to include a situation where the same man in the picture was left defenseless in the face of an which the quote claims. Being one of the most powerful political lobbying groups in the United States, the NRA has the ability to greatly sway the outcome of particular bills. This power is also used to not only attempt to sway politicians, but to connect with the American people. In an attempt to target a fear of being defenseless, the NRA had the ability to create two uniquely different advertisements that share a common goal. Both advertisements capitalize on the four elements of the rhetorical appeal. However, both advertisements could be tweaked to improve the overall message being displayed. For the first image, the NRA may have implemented a particular person to help connect the advertisement to a specific audience as in the second advertisement to establish a greater grounding for kairos. In the second advertisement, the advertisement strongly implements, pathos, ethos and kairos but falls short on logos. The quote speaks of defenselessness, yet the rest of advertisement does not support the quote, giving the quote a weak foundation. Although, both advertisements have distinct differences, the NRA has established two very powerful advertisements which support their call to fight against stricter gun control by using the four rhetorical appeals.
