Bauman 1 Madelyn Bauman Prof. Van Winkle ENC 1102 22 February 2017 The National Center for Fair and Open Testing scores do not equal Scores Do Not Equal This blanket statement, consistently used by The National Center for Fair and Open Testing (FairTest), adequately introduces the basis of their work within the education system. FairTest is strongly against misuses and flaws of standardized National Center for Fair and Open especially due to the fact that they currently play such an influential role in the path of a life. Today, only of the roughly 3,000 four-year colleges and universities in America make SAT or ACT submissions Applicants Sweat the High school students desperately trying to be accepted in to colleges across the country are being judged tremendously on their test scores by the majority of prospective colleges. As colleges place such heavy importance on the scores of standardized tests, their acceptance and scholarship decisions are overpowered by the results of single tests. The two images I gathered from articles on Fair website serve as indicators of the and alike disapproval of high-stakes standardized testing. The National Center for Fair and Open Testing (Fair Test) is an educational organization that serves to quality education and equal opportunity by promoting fair, open, valid and educationally beneficial evaluations of Fair Since its founding in 1985, Fair Test has expanded its reach by gathering more volunteers, operating a frequently updated newsletter and website, and generally providing parents, teachers, and students with the Bauman 2 knowledge on how to resist unfair and misused examinations. Fair Test places special emphasis on the fact that they are also working to the racial, class, gender, and cultural barriers to equal opportunity posed by standardized Fair This quote, coming from the of Fair website, notes that they believe inequality in classrooms across the nation is furthered by standardized testing. Fair Test utilizes the web by producing their own electronic newsletter, The Examiner. This online catalog is the headquarter for information on current issues within the Education Department and how Fair Test and other groups are responding. The website also provides teachers with material to aid them in resisting to the testing often results in a narrow focus on teaching just the tested Happens When Tests Become High According to Fair Test, a serious issue with placing such heavy importance on the results of standardized testing is that teachers feel pressured to teach to the test resulting in tons of memorization and therefore a lack of true learning. Contributor for the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development (ASCD), James Popham, discussed how high-stakes standardized testing results in teaching to the test in his article Teaching to the Test. He explained that, teaching to the test is that is focused directly on test items or on items much like (Popham, to the Groups like ASCD and Fair Test view this negatively because either to test items or to clones of those items eviscerates the validity of score based (Popham, to the This ineffective way of teaching is a result of the pressures placed on teachers to show through standardized test scores that their students not only meet their grade level requirements, but have shown improvement. Bauman 3 Standardized increased implementation comes from the Education desire to strengthen equality amongst students. With the creation of the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) act in 2002, standardized testing became heavily institutionalized. intentions were to the achievement gap between poor and minority students and their more advantaged (Klein, Child Left Despite the positive intentions of NCLB, numerous problems arose since its implementation. As stated previously, the issue of teachers to the teaching solely itemized material prevents students from genuinely learning. Yet teachers are resorting to this method due to the intense pressure placed upon them to show their improvement on cursory data sheets. According to the Economic Policy Institute, have found that teacher attrition and demoralization have been associated with test-based accountability efforts, particularly in high-need with the use of Student Test Scores to Evaluate Tying teacher evaluations to the high-stakes standardized testing of their students is leading to a decrease in effort and desire to teach high- need children. Fair Test has noticed all of these disadvantages associated with implementing such heavy standardized testing in schools. They include persuasive images on their website and newsletter to advocate against standardized testing. Image 1 is positioned at the head of one of Fair articles. The actual photograph is from a protest that appears to be crowded with a majority of protesting children. A young girl holding a simple sign that reads, am more than just a test is the focal point, and therefore emphasized message, of this picture. The title, More Than a Score, simply repeats what the young sign says. Repetition is a helpful and persuasive tool as it emphasizes the message Scores DO Not Equal Scores Do Not Equal that Fair Test is attempting to get across to its viewers. The caption, guide for test resistance and Bauman 4 reform activists in the post NCLB adds more context for the image. No Child Left Behind (NCLB), the act established in 2002, increased the federal role in holding schools responsible for the academic progress of all Child Left Fair Test uses image 1 and their caption to inform the audience that NCLB and its results (the misuse of standardized testing) are increasingly negative. On its own, the photograph does not have an actual trademark from Fair Test to display credibility. Therefore, the ethos of image 1 is established by the surrounding caption and title that further explain the purpose and where it is originating from. Pathos is heavily evoked in this image because it displays a young girl, amongst other young students, protesting something that is seriously affecting them. Children protesting is enough to pull on the heartstrings of any audience and for Fair Test, evoking sympathy was the goal. The very message, am more than just a test coming from a young student incites strong empathy from an audience recently coming across this issue. Fair Test utilizes logos with this image as it shows viewers the extent at which high-stakes standardized testing is negatively affecting students. Logical reasoning allows an audience to see that students feel that they are being seen as nothing more than a test score within the education system. For both image 1 and 2 there is a great implementation of kairos. The misuse of standardized testing has become a recent issue within society and these images work well to display that in a timely manner. Similar to image 1, image 2 displays a photograph surrounded by a caption and title that all speak the same message. The actual photograph depicts a woman holding a sign that reads Testing, More while the surrounding title and caption also comment Testing, Lower Stakes, Better Learning The repetition between the actual photograph and the surrounding text serves to emphasize the message for the audience. Big, bold lettering Bauman 5 also enhances the importance of the phrase Testing, More The coloring of the phrase in blue and red on the actual photograph draws it even more attention. Finally, the focus of the image being solely this phrase brings enough repetition to remember it but also the simplicity to fully comprehend it. The ethos of image 2 is established by the trademark just beneath the photo. It serves to show viewers that Fair Test approves of and aligns themselves with the message of the picture. Protesting evokes strong emotions for an audience, whether it be sympathy or a shared anger. Therefore, pathos is extremely prevalent in image 2 by the captured action of a protest. Whether the protestor in this image is a young-adult student or teacher, logos is utilized as the audience infers that the effect of heavy testing is so negative that it is causing people to protest. The National Center for Fair and Open Testing is dedicated to spreading awareness for the issues imposed by high-stakes standardized testing. Per their mission statement, they to end the misuses and flaws of standardized testing and to ensure that evaluation of students, teachers and schools is fair, open, valid and educationally This outlined goal is enhanced by the insertion of images throughout their articles. The images discussed in this essay both portrayed impactful phrases displayed on signs to emphasize the damage high-stakes standardized testing is causing students and teachers alike.
