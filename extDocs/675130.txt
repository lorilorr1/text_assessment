Ward 1 Robert Ward Mr. Brendan Jackson ENC 1101 28 February 2017 Automation and Technological Advancement Ethics play a major role in the discussion surrounding automation, and the potential effects it could have on society if we disregard those ethical dilemmas. Ethical philosophy plays a major role in our discussion on automation, I think Mayer said it best in 2008 by concluding that ethical philosophical approaches are now necessary and that they will guide the framework to justify technology and safety oriented decisions on the basis of ethical and moral standards in regards to humans and their behaviors (Mayer). You can see the severity of the nature of these discussions, in 2015 abstract was focused heavily on the ethical nature of automation, and the potential adverse effects that could come into play with the master-slave dialect proposed in the abstract. In this abstract, Coeckelbergh points out that the discussion about automation technologies (including Artificial intelligence) is always referred to in the terms of master and slaves in term of technological advancement of not only manufacturing processes, but even home living, education, and public services. This raises potential areas for philosophical debate in regards to the human-machine relations, as well as the development of Artificial Intelligence as own being with their own rights. This discussion could go on for centuries and never be settled in entirety. Due to the subjective nature of philosophy, new ideas and discussion are brought forth consistently in the academic community. You can see this by comparing the discussions presented by the two different authors from entirely different counties. They both come down to one general question, Ward 2 what potential behavior changes are we likely to see, as well as what their potential negative effects could entail. Many are worried that in the coming years, we will be so reliant on technology that any failures could potentially be catastrophic in nature. In one section of his abstract, Coecklebergh presents these potential situations, in which humans are still the masters of the slaves of our endeavours, as opposed to being slaves towards technological processes, and also reiterated that while we are the masters, we will likely remain troubled. This is due to the imperfect nature of humans, as long as we are part of the equation, there will always be far greater room for error. While both authors agree that automation of technology is a driving force behind our advancements as society, Mayer specifically concludes that automation processes must be implemented in a way that benefit everyone involved, where there is still a major human-centered approach in the production of goods and services. The construction industry is undoubtedly one of the most important industries to keep up to date, cost effective, and efficient. Scholars studying the construction industry have long proposed that as the industry becomes more technologically advanced, greater feats and designs will be able to be developed and brought to fruition. The term Industry 4.0 has be thrown around for the last few years in regards to the advancement of the construction industry, as well as the incorporation of more digital procedures as well as automated processes. Oesterreich and Teuteberg formulated an industry specific definition to contextualize the term for the Industry 4.0, in regards to automation and digitisation in the construction industry. As more construction companies switch to an Industry 4.0 model, see faster build times, with more efficient and thoroughly tested designs. The authors both agree that the Industry 4.0 definition entails End-to- End digitisation of engineering implementations across the board, as well as complete automation of the manufacturing environment. Ward 3 In abstract, he presents that construction managers are using Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) in order to streamline worksite processes. At that time back in 2005, PDAs were top the line technology that really helped with structure and accountability at the work site. Back in 2005, I doubt they realized the technological advancements have today presented in the abstract by Oesterreich and Teuteberg. Maas also presents automated machines that are not entirely automated and have to have a human sponsor involved to ensure that everything is done correctly. This is a stark change in mindset compared to the latest source on the subject, where the human factor is almost entirely taken out of play. If Maas had an insight into what our current technological accomplishments would be, sure he would have mentioned entirely automated processes, and due to the fact that they mentioned, well within reason to believe that Maas just simply think that type of technological precision would be available to the industry as a whole. The age gap between the two abstracts is less than a decade, yet reading the two it almost seems as if written from entirely different centuries in terms of technological capabilities. As presented in the Industry 4.0 abstract, technology has fundamentally changed the entire industry from the ground up. Architects and engineers now design entire structures in design software, where their projects can be tested for various strengths and weaknesses during the design process. Foreman at construction sites can view digital visual representations of these completed works in their entirety through every phase in the building process. The construction industry is surely entering into the realm of science-fiction with entirely automated manufacturing and production environments, nonetheless, the research and development portions within this industry see very little funding, seeing less than 1% of the total sales revenue on average (Oesterreich & Teuteberg).
