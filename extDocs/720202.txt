Andrew Musgrove Ms. Elizabeth Ricketts ENC 1101 9 April 2017 U.S. Politics and Cybersecurity Cyberattacks are the most imminent, destructive threats against the United States right now. This is illustrated by the Russian election hacking which released hundreds of private Democratic National Convention emails and showed that U.S. cyberspace is not secure. That attack influenced the presidential election to an extent that has never been seen before. even scarier than the Russian election hacking is the hundreds of other cyberattacks that happen daily in the U.S.. In 2008, the U.S. military computer system was hacked by a that scanned data and opened doors in the system for about 14 months before it was destroyed. A is a computer program that spreads through a network by replicating itself, just like a virus in the human body. This military hacking did not directly cause any damage, but it did illustrate the vulnerabilities of even one of the United most secure computer systems. Technology is evolving at a faster rate than it ever has, and this adds to the difficulty and ineffectiveness of cybersecurity policies. As one computer technology is finally adequately protected, a new system comes out that has flaws and cannot be completely protected. Cybersecurity is a major issue that is addressed by the national government consistently, but policies are constantly rendered ineffective because of the speed of evolution of technology. Although cybersecurity has been a major focus of the national security agenda in the 21 st century, the U.S. cyberspace has been devastated by foreign attacks in recent years. Therefore, current U.S. cybersecurity policies are not effective enough and must be improved by utilizing proactive cybersecurity, and by increasing connections between the public and private sectors. The U.S. cybersecurity problems stem from the fact that cybersecurity policies implemented by legislators are not effective enough because they are severely out of date. According to Mark Milone, many of the governing policies concerning computer security are found in The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act which was passed in 1986 (Milone 78). The year in which this was passed is very alarming; 1986 was 31 years ago! That means that the U.S. major policies concerning cybersecurity were passed 2 years after the first Macintosh computer was released. Michael Chertoff also points out that the U.S. cybersecurity agenda was bolstered with President George Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Inititive in 2008 (Chertoff 3). President cybersecurity initiative in 2008 was designed to bring attention to the growing threat of cyber-attacks and prepare the country for the future. Nine years is not that long ago, but in technology development, 2008 is ancient. The very first Iphone came out in 2007, and in 2008, the 2 nd version of the MacBook had just been released. MacBooks today have over double the processing power that they did in 2008. There have been countless calls to action from researchers in recent years because of outdated policies. August Roesener, a U.S. Air Force researcher for 19 years writes, . . do not adequately address the ever- increasing threat in the cyberspace (Bottolfson 50). When discussing threats against the global infrastructure, former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff writes that a cyber-attack would be the complex and potentially (Chertoff 480). The research community agrees that current cybersecurity policies are outdated and clearly not effective enough to defend the country in the future. For there to be improvements in U.S. cyber defenses, proactive cybersecurity must be implemented. Currently, most policies are reactive, meaning that they are passed after an attack has occurred and are designed to limit the severity of future attacks in the future. On the other hand, proactive cybersecurity encompasses everything that can be done to prevent a cyber-attack from occurring in the first place. However, convincing lawmakers to utilize proactive cybersecurity can be very difficult because of the nature of politics. The U.S. government and lawmakers cannot do everything in their power to prevent cyberattacks because of privacy laws and foreign affairs. Mark Milone highlights the effectiveness of proactive cybersecurity in Hacktivism. He writes about the importance of surveillance technology, and the effectiveness of cryptography, or encryption (Milone 81-82). One of the most useful surveillance technologies he describes is ECHELON, automated global interception and relay system. . . may intercept as many as 3 billion communications every (Milone 83). For obvious reasons, the use of ECHELON is questionable because some countries may not want to U.S. government listening to everything that goes on around the world. The capability of ECHELON to detect a cyber-attack before it happens is high however, which adds to the complexity of the cybersecurity issue. Encryption is another very useful type of proactive cybersecurity that is effective, but underutilized because the U.S. must be able to communicate with allies and to others in the system. If the encryption is too complicated, even the people who the government wants in the U.S. cyberspace cant access it. According to Mark Milone, a common practice is weakening the encryptions to facilitate law enforcement (Milone 82). This leads to a weaker cyberspace that is easier to hack by foreign attackers because of the weakened encryptions. The complexity of these proactive cybersecurity measures leads to underuse and therefore, a weaker cyberspace in general. Another huge problem concerning the U.S. cyberspace is the lack of communication and connection between the public and private sectors. The public sector refers to the government , and the private sector includes private businesses and corporations. The government has its hands tied by politics and cannot engage in but private businesses have a smaller degree of transparency and can be more aggressive when defending against cyberattacks. Michael Chertoff writes that, cyberspace will require an unprecedented series of partnerships between the public and private (Chertoff 483). Private businesses do not have to deal with the political restrictions that a government does, so their cybersecurity policies can be more According to Amanda Craig, businesses have been known to to discourage a future cyberattack from cyberterrorists (Craig 749). This is something that the U.S. government cannot do because of the political nature of foreign affairs. A by a foreign government could be a call for war. However, an increase in public and private sector connection could give the U.S. government a way to defend itself without starting a war. This has shown to be effective before. In 2010. Google was attacked by a source originating from Taiwan, and when Google noticed that this source was also responsible for government attacks, they worked with the U.S. government to eventually trace the responsibility to China (Craig 749). This type of connection and communication is what is necessary to defend the country against the cyberattacks of the future. The U.S. government can sometimes have its hands tied by politics and be restricted and reserved in the amount of proactive and active cyber defense that it utilizes, but assistance from the private sector could put the U.S. government a step ahead of foreign attackers. While most researchers agree that U.S. cyberspace is not adequately protected, others argue that recent legislation has been effective when it comes to reducing the severity of cyberattacks. For example, former Secretary of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff, points out that President Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative was effective at fortifying the cyber defenses and raising awareness about the cybersecurity issue. It accomplished this by increasing funding for cybersecurity education and improving the Department of supercomputer, Einstein (Chertoff). Similarly, Jeremy Broggi explains the effectiveness of executive order 13363 signed by President Obama in 2014. The order established the Enhanced Cybersecurity Services (ECS) which can and mitigate malicious cyber (Broggi 657). Although these pieces of legislation seem like a step in the right direction, they clearly are not effective enough. Since these acts were passed, the FBI and Department of Defense have both been breached, the DNC had thousands of emails hacked and released, the U.S. Treasury had documents leaked, and hundreds of business have been exploited. arguments that cyber security legislation has been effective are invalid because in 2015 alone, there was 77,000 cyberattacks against the U.S., over 200 per day! Cyberattacks have increased by 1300% in the last decade, so clearly more needs to be done to secure the U.S. cyberspace. Although the current status of U.S. cyberspace is very worrying to most researchers, the future of cybersecurity is getting more attention as it becomes a bigger threat. Proactive defense and an increase in connection between government and business have proved to be effective steps towards securing the U.S. cyberspace. However, politics seems to always be an obstacle when trying to pass effective cybersecurity policies. What the government needs is a bipartisan department within the executive branch that can address cybersecurity without the burden of Congress. Much like the Department of Homeland Security keeps the nation safe on a daily basis, this of would be responsible for keeping the U.S. cyberspace safe on a daily basis. Along with this new department, public awareness needs to be prioritized in order to force the government to act sooner rather than later. This is an issue that requires attention now, the U.S. needs to be proactive and stop the next debilitating cyber-attack before it occurs. Works Cited Bottolfson, Carl, Gerry Fernandez, and August G.
