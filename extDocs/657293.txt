Emily Edgington Spencer Bennington English Comp II 26 February 2017 The NRA I. Thesis: While the two images support the common purpose of decreasing gun violence, each images portray the need for gun safety in a completely different context. II. Paragraph 1 Imagery and how it differs between image 1 and 2 Kairos: police officer in image 2 represents the prominence of gun violence in schools at this particular time, must be stopped as soon as possible The image of the hooded man in image 1 represents an immediate threat to the girl, symbolizes a danger that needs to be solved right away. III. Paragraph 2 Use of background and lighting and how image 1 and 2 both use it to support the same purpose, but use it in different ways. Image one is very dark and gloomy, represents an immediate danger that gun safety training can prevent. Image two has brighter colors and a happy background which represents that teaching gun safety in schools will drastically decrease danger. IV. Paragraph 3 Use of people, and what their facial expressions represent. (through pathos) Officer in image 2 represents security and safety, which correlates to feelings about how the gun program will make people feel. Image 1 the girl is frightened which makes people think that is how they will be if they do not have the gun safety training. V. Conclusion Tie back imagery, background, and use of people to the common purpose: using gun safety seminars to decrease gun violence. Works Cited NRA  NRA Home. NRA, n.d. Web. 31 Jan. 2017.
