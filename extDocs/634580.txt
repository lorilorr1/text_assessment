Recently, there has been a debate about adding art into the STEM program to reform it into STEAM. One of the stakeholders that is for integrating art into STEAM is the Rhode Island School of Design, also known as RISD. On the other side, we have the Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). PCAST is only focused on STEM education itself and believes that only the subjects that are in the STEM field is involved in our economy, which means that only STEM alone can improve it. While we have one side only focused on STEM, and the other side focused on integrating STEAM, it is clear that the best compromise that both sides would agree on is to create a trial run by making summer camps, classes, or workshops to see just how adding art into STEM can really effect the economy. The first stakeholder is the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). They want to integrate art into the STEM program to reform it into STEAM. According to the RISD website, goal is to foster the true innovation that comes with combining the mind of a scientist or technologist with that of an artist or John Maeda, the President of the Rhode Island School of Design, has been arguing that an for art needs to be added to turn STEM into STEAM because the challenges the next generation faces will demand creative solutions that STEM cannot do alone McClure 2 (Maeda). Art is all about creativity and opening the mind to see complex ideas that can be hidden from plain sight. The fact of the matter is, art can be important to the economy. As Maeda states, creates the innovative products and solutions that will propel or economy forward, and artists ask the deep questions about humanity that reveal which way forward actually (Maeda). This kind of mindset is what the economy needs to get a step forward in the world. As the economy and society change, the curriculum needs to change as well. There are many benefits that art has to offer the world and to STEM, but PCAST seems to disagree. PCAST refuses to think about how much art can reform STEM for the better. PCAST, also known as the Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, is an advisory group of the leading scientists and engineers appointed by the President to make advice about the scientific and technological world available to him from inside the White House (Holdren 4). PCAST believes that only the STEM program can help boost our economy. They believe that art plays a vital role in the lives of Americans. John Holdren, the Director of PCAST, mentioned in the report to the President, need for STEM knowledge extends to all Americans. The products of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics play a substantial and growing role in the lives of all (25). When Holdren mentioned that STEM is a growing role, he was talking about jobs. As Nancy Dejarnette states, need for professionals in the fields of Science and Technology fields in the United States has seen steady growth over the past (181). why helping to improve these programs is important to our society today. These two stakeholders are so passionate about their standings that they refuse to see that they both have some common ground with each other. Both PCAST and RISD agree that an improved curriculum will better prepare students for the world and help the economy. The only problem is McClure 3 that there are different viewpoints on how to change the curriculum and what that change can do. In Ralph article Teaching The Arts Across The Curriculum: Meanings, Policy And  He states that, promoting across the could become creative thinkers going forward in the 21st century [and able to meet the challenges of an ever- changing (2). belief coincides with RISD because they both believe that promoting art can help boost the economy. On the other hand, there is the combined belief between PCAST and Nancy Dejarnette when she states that, students are engaged in STEM activities, they will also gain experience with 21 st Century skills such as critical thinking, collaboration and communication that will help prepare them to compete on the global (186). Both of these statements involve the fact that with a changed curriculum, the experiences that people gain will benefit them in the 21 st century. Considering the fact that both of these stakeholders have a common ground, it makes it easier to come up with a compromise that they both could agree on. PCAST and RISD have their way and make each other happy. Each one of them will have to give something up in order to gain something. However, because of this, it can help create a new program that could change education. Kennedy mentions that in the report that PCAST prepared for the president, they provided some strategies for improving K-12 STEM education. To go along side strategy, Dejarnette even stated that, summer camps, classes, and workshops for elementary students to experience hands-on scientific inquiry and technological design activities will engage young learners with STEM disciplines and content that they might not otherwise (186). Developing summer camps and other experiences are a great idea, but instead of making it only focused on STEM, they could add art into it. Of course, PCAST agree to adding art into STEM. Therefore, a good compromise is to make a couple of camps and add art McClure 4 into them as a trial run to see how adding art effects the STEM organization. This way PCAST gets to keep STEM for the time being and RISD gets to show that art has the potential benefit STEM. If the trial turns for the good, then PCAST might be willing to add art to STEM which would make goal come true. Although the STEM program has kept itself going for so long. a good time to initiate a change. Adding art into STEM a bad idea. There are many ways that art can help improve STEM and still make both sides happy. Since PCAST might not be completely for adding art, it makes sense to have a trial run to see how everything goes. Having a summer camp, some classes, and a workshop are great ways to test the waters. Since STEM already has a lot of supporters, getting the money for these camps, classes, and workshops be too hard. Using these other foundations and organizations to help open these camps can benefit the future. Opening these extra classes can give more students an education in the subjects involved in STEAM. If STEM and art can boost the economy separately, imagine what they can do together. Both sides make compelling cases for why their views are the most important. However, if they could get a chance to see what would happen if they were to work together, they might realize that helping each other and joining forces could boost the economy.

He is a principal investigator with the Centre for Brain Research and he is involved with five other research topics as well. This article helps shape my compromise because it provides the ways that art can be beneficially to people and other subjects in school. The goal of this article is to show just how important art education is when it comes to school. Since it was mentioned that art can help other subjects, it helps support my cause that adding art into STEM can also benefit the STEM program while presenting more attention to art.

This source is important because it is written by my stakeholder and it gives all the information about their side of their argument on how STEM education is more important that anything else since it is causing McClure 6 more of an impact on our economy than it used to. Because this source is written by one of my stakeholders, it holds higher importance than the rest of my sources. Kennedy, T. J, and M. R.L, Odell.

John Maeda was a Professor at the MIT Media Lab for 12 years, and then he became the President of the Rhode Island School of Design. This article is related to my research because not only written by the President of RISD, which is one of my stakeholders, but it also discusses why art is so important.

They were founded in 1877 and their goal is to foster the true innovation that comes with combining the mind of a scientist or technologist with that of an artist or designer. This source fits into my research because it helps add the point of view of why art is important and why it should become STEAM. It points out one side of the disagreement, but it also helps boost my compromise.
