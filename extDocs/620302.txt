Sherer 1 Julia Sherer Professor Pearlstone ENC 1102 25 January 2017 Vaccine Safety Within the past few decades, there has been a serious concern of whether or not vaccines are completely safe. While some will complete their own research and form their own opinion, others will listen to what any leading drug company says. The conflict between these groups is their differing opinion on the safety of vaccines. According to the company Merck Pharmaceuticals, their goals are to create the best vaccines in order to help the lives of others. However, the National Vaccine Information Center is dedicated to educating the public on the health risks of vaccines. The conflict between these two groups would be whether or not vaccines are totally safe. The compromise between these two groups would have to be willingness to change. Merck Pharmaceuticals would need to test their vaccines more in depth to thoroughly make sure that they are safe, and the National Vaccine Information Center would need to fully educate the public on the positives and the negatives of vaccines. Merck Pharmaceuticals, the second largest drug company in America, is committed to creating a difference in the lives of others by producing modern vaccines and medicine. Their mission statement says, discover, develop, and provide innovative products and services that save and improve lives around the the World be Merck Pharmaceuticals works with many different diseases including: cancer, cardio-metabolic disease, hepatitis C, and With over 68,000 employees in over 140 countries, Merck has discovered hundreds of vaccines and medical products. Furthermore, each year they have published hundreds of papers and articles in leading reviewed journal. Overall, Merck Sherer 2 Pharmaceuticals pushes for curiosity and creativeness to be able to build the best possible product. On the other hand, the National Vaccine Information Center is a nonprofit organization that works to promote vaccine safety. They are dedicated to the prevention of vaccine deaths and injuries through educating the public. over three decades, they have been the leading voice in vaccine safety by monitoring the vaccine research, development, regulation, policymaking, and legislation from their headquarters in Washington does NVIC Inform the Public about Vaccine Not only do they monitor others findings, but they also conducts their own original research that they publish in their weekly newsletter. They have also formed a database called the Vaccine Reaction Registry for those who have been affected by a vaccine injury to post their stories. In addition, they also offer counseling and guidance to those who need it. All around, the NVIC works to help the community be able to make an informed decision on the safety of vaccines. With that being said, the National Vaccine Information Center and Merck Pharmaceuticals have completely different motives. Yet, they still have the same common purpose: to do what is best for the community. National Vaccine Information Center represents citizens from every state, who support the principle of informed consent to medical treatment, which has become a central ethical principle in the practice of modern medicine and is applied to medical interventions which involve the risk of injury or (Fisher). While the NVIC works towards educating the public, Merck works towards formulating a tangible product for the community. unique vaccines have helped prevent a number of diseases, including ones never thought and Prescribing Although each Sherer 3 company is heading towards a different outcome, they still have the same goal for the community. Since their common goal is to do what is best for the community, the compromise between these two groups would have to be for the NVIC to fully educate the public on the good and the bad of vaccines. Often times, NVIC will only write about the negative impacts of vaccines or will try to invalidate the finding of drug companies. Whereas, Merck Pharmaceutical needs to test their findings more in depth in order to effectively help the community. In 2010, Merck was accused of lying about their findings, and in result a lawsuit was filed. lawsuit, which was unsealed in late June, alleges that Merck defrauded the U.S. for over 10 years by overstating the MMR (Wrangham). In order for this compromise to work, Merck would need to be completely honest about the effectiveness of their products. Each company would need to put forth extra time to maximize the productivity of this compromise. In conclusion, the question of whether or not vaccines are completely safe is still up in the air. Although each company has a different view of vaccines, they have the same purpose: to do what is best for the community. The NVIC would need to be willing to tell the community about the positives of vaccines, while Merck would need to research more and tell the truth about their products. Overall, the compromise between these two groups would have to be willingness to change. These two companies could have the opportunity to come together to create an even bigger force.
