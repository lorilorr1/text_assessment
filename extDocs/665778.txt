Aye Aye Sint ENC-1102 Dr. Oana Cimpean 26 th February 2017 Project 2: Intermediate Draft According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), solar energy is a energy which means that solar plant or solar panels can be built as a distributed generation, utility-scale solar power and central-station. Solar energy is the use of sunlight to produce electricity for the uses of homes, industries as well as factories. Solar energy is a sustainable, clean and affordable energy that can be find everywhere. SEIA believes that spreading the uses of solar energy around the world would help to reduce global warming. So their mission is to build solar panel around the world. The organization uses poster to spread the uses of solar energy to get investment from the people. The poster uses ethos, pathos, logos and Kairos to expand the uses of solar energy in United States. In picture 1, the main idea about the poster is to demonstrate the fast development of solar nation that will help Americans to create more jobs, increase the income of the country and especially to reduce pollution. It also explains about the for freedom of choice, affirming the right of lowans to decide how they want to power their homes and businesses in the (Resch, 2014). The SEIA uses Uncle Sam to make the audience feel that everyone especially Americans has to care about the environment by investing money in solar energy project. Uncle Sam who is a common national personification of the United States or American government and become important person in World War 1 in 1812. This make American feels special. The world need tells that need everyone to make the world better place and to save natural resources such as coal. Ethos is an appeal to ethics and it means of convincing someone of the character or credibility of the persuader. In the poster the ethos is the Uncle Sam. It increases the credibility when the poster uses the name of the organization with the actual link at the bottom of the poster. Logos is an appeal to logic and is a way of persuading an audience by reason. The logos in the poster is that solar growing and invest American which means that by building more solar panel help America to sustain the future use of natural resources as solar energy comes from the sun. According to Merriam-Webster dictionary Kairos means time when conditions are right for the accomplishment of a crucial action: the opportune and decisive Kairos in the poster is that tax is expiring which means that Americans should invest their money right now otherwise you will miss the chance. It also tells that this is the right time to invest money in solar energy to save the environment and also for the stake of American future we need to do it now when it is not too late. In picture 2, the poster is used by the University of Delaware to find more advanced technology about solar panel. The poster uses the picture of the sunlight which means that make the world with full of sunshine. The ray of sunshine on the picture make people to have positive mind, often during at difficult times. It also make the audience feel that make the environment we stay to be safe and clean and sustain the natural resources we have on the earth. It is telling to have empathy on the earth. The orange color of the sunshine in the picture make people feel emotional or physical to feel sensual, warm and secure. Logos is that U.S. Photovoltaics Industry Roadmap Through 2030 and which mean that in the future the US photovoltaics industry will become one of the important industry and that everyone will use solar panel everywhere. The future of solar energy is bright as the technology is developing. This poster is credible because it is posted in the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) this poster is used in solar power program at the University of Delaware for their project to develop solar power. The Kairos in this picture shows that people should start to use solar power now so that we can see the brighter future like the sunshine through 2030 and beyond which means that it will helps to reduce pollution and global warming. In conclusion, both of the picture are used to advertise the use of solar energy in the future and the organization wants everyone especially the citizen of American to become more interested in the use of solar energy. Their main goal is to develop advanced technology with affordable, clean and sustainable energy and wants to make the world green. The organization uses rhetorical appeals- pathos, ethos, logos and Kairos to attract the audience. Picture 1 Picture 2 Works cited: Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) Resh. R, for US.
