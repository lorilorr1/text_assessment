A GREENER ENVIRONEMNT VIA HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS 1 A Greener Environment Via Hydrogen Fuel Cells Kaung Su Khin Zaw University of South Florida A GREENER ENVIRONEMNT VIA HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS 2 A Greener Environment Via Hydrogen Fuel Cells Due to the use of fossil fuels for everyday energy sources, especially electricity and transportation, a considerable amount of carbon dioxide which causes the global warming detrimentally, has been produced from burning of fossil fuels which are made up of carbon and hydrogen compounds. While burning, hydrogen and carbon compounds in fossil fuels turn into carbon dioxid. According to statics and results from researches, 87 percent of human made carbon dioxide emission was produced from burning of fossil fuels such as natural gas, coals, and oils for transportation. (Le Quere et.al, 2012). In order to reduce carbon dioxide emission due to fossil fuels, an alternative renewable technology called hydrogen fuel cell has been researched and introduced to people for bringing a greener environment in the future. Although safety and expensive production of hydrogen fuel cells hinder the use of hydrogen fuel cells in vehicles, this alternative energy resource provides with benefits such as renewability, zero emission of carbon dioxide, and non-toxicity to not only humans and animals but also to the environment. (Engebretson, 2009). Even though vehicles with using hydrogen fuel cells were introduced in some parts of the United States and Europe and Asia in the way that hydrogen fuel cell buses were used for transportation of athletes and tourists in the Winter Olympic 2011, the popularity of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles is still low. To promote hydrogen fuel cell energy, governments and motor companies should invest more in research of hydrogen fuel cells and we should support the use of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell organizations for the better and greener environment in the future. According to Fuel Cell & Hydrogen Energy Association (FCHEA), a hydrogen fuel cell is the best option among alternative renewable energy resources because it does not give off any harmful gas to the environment. In a hydrogen fuel cell, the combustion of hydrogen gas A GREENER ENVIRONEMNT VIA HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS 3 produces heat energy which makes engines of vehicles work. The efficiency of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles equals to that of fossil fuel vehicles as hydrogen fuel cell research states that a fuel cell provides a combination of high because of its output energy as effective as that of fossil fuels whereas other renewable energy resources supply only 10 percent of daily energy usage. Since hydrogen fuel cells simply produce water as a by-product, fuel cells are regarded as an operation that most other energy conversion devices (Sharaf, and Orham, 2017). In addition, hydrogen used in fuel cells can be produced by any time as hydrogen is one of the most abundant gases in the nature. One of most common methods is splitting of water in electrolysis process. Thus, unlike fossil fuels, people do not need to worry about running out of fuels for transportation and electricity in the future. In comparison of renewability of hydrogen fuel cells, that of fossil fuels is much lower as fossil fuels have started running out. Therefore, hydrogen fuel cells can become the predominant source of energy due to its eco-friendly advantages that could benefit the society. In the earlier, most people were afraid to use hydrogen fuel cell vehicles according to surveys conducts by U.S energy department because they thought that hydrogen is highly flammable and explosive. However, in June 2009, more than 300 fuel cell passenger vehicles and transit buses, and 26 hydrogen fuel stations were placed into California communities. From surveys and feedback, people did not notice that these vehicles were run with hydrogen fuel cells and most people explained that filling hydrogen in hydrogen station was easy to handle and safe as they followed the procedures. (Dunwoody, 2009). Recently, Toyota Automobile Company has recently produced Miral, a car that runs on hydrogen fuel cells in order to promote the use of hydrogen fuel cells. Likewise, many motor companies are interested in producing vehicles with A GREENER ENVIRONEMNT VIA HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS 4 hydrogen fuel cells. Researchers and scientists have been conducted several experiments to reduce the cost of hydrogen fuel cells for the mass production in the future. On the other hand, it can also be argued that fossil fuels are still needed to provide energy for production of hydrogen gas because in the process of electrolysis, thermal energy (heat) is used to split water molecules into hydrogen so hydrogen fuel cells are not eco-friendly to the environment. Since the aspects of fossil fuels include in the production of hydrogen in hydrogen fuel cells, hydrogen fuel cells depend on fossil fuels indirectly. However, recently innovative technology and research prove that hydrogen can be produced using energy provided from alternative energy resources such as solar and wind power. Thus, hydrogen fuel cells are not dependent on fossil fuel. To support this alternative, in Saudi Arabia, the percentage of electricity from wind energy and solar energy in different places was analyzed, concluding that hydrogen production is relatively more ecofriendly with wind energy and solar energy. The price of hydrogen gas if mass produced, would be lower than that of fossil fuels (Al-Sharafi et al. 2017). Without doubt, hydrogen fuel cells can bring the greener environment with zero emission of carbon dioxide in the future. To sum up, hydrogen fuel cells can change the world by reducing global warming and climate change. The impacts of global warming are melting of polar ice caps, flooding, storms and climate changes. People are fighting to decrease the rate of global warming by the variety of methods such as recycling papers or plastics and so on. However, global warming occurs mainly due to burning of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels play an important role in providing energy for transportation in our daily lives and produce tons of carbon dioxide in the environment. In order to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels, people should change the use of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles because it can bring a huge impact on reducing the rate of global A GREENER ENVIRONEMNT VIA HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS 5 warming due to carbon dioxide. From my perspectives of reducing global warming, people should utilize eco-friendly products such as hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and support organizations which conduct research and experiments for hydrogen fuel cells.
