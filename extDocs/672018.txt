Dean 1 Casey Dean Sarah Basil ENC 1102 26 February 2017 The Reality of Teen Pregnancies Recent controversy on the future of Planned Parenthood has become prevalent after word of defunding federal funding has risen. Being an important organization associated with reproductive healthcare, defunding Planned Parenthood would affect a clear majority of women in the United States and ultimately create more problems in addition to the ones that are already prevalent within the country. One of these current issues that the country faces is unplanned pregnancies. Every year unplanned pregnancies effect a significant number of teenage girls, whether it be the result of contraceptive failure, lack of contraceptive use or incorrect contraceptive use. Births resulting from unplanned pregnancies are often associated with adverse maternal and child health outcomes, such as delayed prenatal care, premature birth, and negative physical and mental health effects for children. Because of this it has become a public health goal to reduce the number of unplanned/teenage pregnancies in the country to both improve the lives of children and teenage girls. With planned parenthood losing funding unplanned pregnancies by teenage girls would only continue to increase. A stakeholder known as the is an organization concerned with raising awareness of the devastating consequences of teen pregnancies. foundation shares their content with other organizations like Planned Parenthood to reach teens simultaneously and have a greater impact. The content they share are advertisements they created using rhetorical appeals in order to show Dean 2 the consequences and realities of unplanned teen pregnancies and make an impact on the teen population in hopes to decrease the number of pregnancies. The foundation was started in 2001 right around when teen pregnancy in the United States was alarmingly high. Neil Cole the founder of the foundation stated in an interview with ABC news that we at known for selling high-heel, one could say sexy shoes. And we saw this issue that, you know, we found out about eight years ago that almost one million teenagers were getting pregnant. And we were astounded by the figures. So, you know, as a company, we decided to give back. And it was best to talk to teenagers. And tell them that just because wearing high-heel, sexy shoes, that you obviously should not have a (Cuomo). Being a company that sells products to mainly teenage girls it is smart to use the company to reach out to its customers in order to address a serious issue among them. The Foundation is known for using celebrities on their advertisements in doing so they are able to speak to teens using their own language. The purpose of their campaign is to influence teen culture and impact the way they think about teen pregnancy and realize the resulting consequences (Mission). Their campaign against teen pregnancy has been ultimately effective in making an impact on the youth of the United States. Since 2001 the number of births a year for teenagers ages 15-19 has decreased by an estimated 300,000 (Division of Vital Statistics). The foundation campaign for teen pregnancy was effective because of the rhetorical appeals used in each advertisement. Pathos is the quality of the image that appeals to emotions. Both images from the Foundation use pathos to evoke emotion from the audience. The way both images are structured with a black background and a black and white picture of a celebrity shows the seriousness of the topic. In the first image Bristol Palin, who is Dean 3 one of the most famous teen moms is pictured with her son. Both her and her son have a very emotionless expression instead of a smile which provokes a negative emotion toward being a teen mom. The quote from Bristol placed next to her picture reads never thought I would be a the tone of regret in this statement adds to the negative feel of emotion in this advertisement as well. In addition, using words like in both advertisements appeals to pathos as well by making the audience associate teen pregnancies with bad endings. Ethos used in an image appeals to the creditability of the information displayed. The celebrities shown on each image are a common use of ethos. Bristol Palin, being a widely known teenage mom gives her relevance to the topic of teen pregnancies. The audience is likely to believe the information coming from her is true because she has lived through it. For the second image, using Hayden Panettiere as a figure to represent the foundation is effective because many teenage girls admire her. Being an actress in films directed toward the youth of America she is widely known by the intended audience and can support the trustworthiness of the information. In addition to using celebrities the Foundation also proves creditability by including their website on each advertisement. In doing so they are giving the audience the option to look in to the organization in depth if they wish to do so. The use of ethos in these advertisements strengthens the legitimacy of their campaign making it effective. Logos is the use of logic in an advertisement which can be seen in the Foundation campaign. If an argument uses logic and makes sense, then people are more likely to agree with it. The first image gives a statistic of than 750,000 teenage girls will become pregnant this which supports that teen pregnancies are an issue in the United States. Seeing such a surprising statistic is likely to persuade the audience into agreeing against teen Dean 4 pregnancies, and with a negative attitude toward them, teenage girls are more likely to take precaution toward not getting pregnant. The second image also provides logos using a statistic, a baby can cost over $10,000 a This is another surprising statistic that intended to make the audience think against becoming a teen parent because most teenagers from ages 15-19 are not financially stable enough to raise a child themselves seeing a number like this would make them think twice and be more cautious when getting involved in sexual relations. Another logical aspect of the second image is the way the question really the way you pictured your first crib, is worded. By phrasing the question this way they are directing the question specifically to teenagers by using words they understand. Most adults would not refer to a house as a crib but teenagers would and by phrasing the question this way they are trying to make a point that having a child as a teenager can change your intended future drastically. Using this logic within their advertisements successfully shows the reality and consequences of teen pregnancies. Teenage pregnancies are something that can happen unexpectedly but be changed once they happen. In addition to being able to have access to all the necessary preventatives of pregnancies it is also important for all teenagers to take into account what repercussions can come from being a teen parent and why the Foundation created a campaign directed toward exposing teen pregnancies for what they really are. Each specific rhetorical appeal used in the advertisements contributes to effectiveness of the advertisement making it successful in conveying information and influencing teenagers to consider the consequences of teen pregnancy and parenthood.
