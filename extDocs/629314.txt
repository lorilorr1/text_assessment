Cronshaw, Ian, and R. Quentin Grafton. Economic Benefits, External Costs And The Regulation Of Unconventional Gas In The United  Energy Policy 98.(2016): 180- 186. ScienceDirect. Web. 5 Feb. 2017. The article Benefits, External Costs And The Regulation Of Unconventional Gas In The United focuses on the production and regulation patterns of natural gas produced using unconventional methods. Unconventional gas (UCG) includes horizontal drilling, hydraulic fracturing, 3-D and 4-D seismic imaging, coiled tubing, measurement while drilling and slimhole drilling. According to Ian Cronshaw and R. Quentin Grafton, hydraulic fracturing gained the most controversy, due to the use of chemicals. As a result, most regulations have been made in relation to this type of drilling. Anderson 2 Kochtcheeva, Lada V.
