For any aspiring doctor medical school bills is one of the biggest aspects on their mind which can stop them from reaching their goal. However, without a tuition the work ethic and autonomy (Fisher, medical school? Not a great can be compromised. Everyone needs an incentive whether it be money, affection, or recognition. Without incentives people are not pushed to give the best quality of what they are delivering and that can be detrimental not only for the giver but the receiver, especially in health care.

When doctors went through the brutal 4 years that graduate school demand from them not only with the work load but with the stress of having loans to repay for the years to come. But that doctor is not the only having to repay. The salary that they will get will insure them a high quality of life and the means to repay the loans. That income is their incentive to work hard, take the best care of their patients, and even progress in the developments for cures. The reason why a tuition ensures their income is because if tuition is free than that leaves the government to pay for it instead of students and where will the government get that money from? The tax payers. and once the government has that power to decide their pay and their hours. This leaves many questions like, this new medical school curriculum model shun individual ingenuity in favor of health care budgetary imperatives? When a doctor has little monetary skin in the game, how will such a system assure an adequate work ethic from doctors going (Fisher, Medical School? Not a Great Idea). $0 $20,000 $40,000 $60,000 $80,000 $100,000 $120,000 $140,000 $160,000 $180,000 1978 1988 1998 2011 Tuitions ( In 2011 constant dollars) Year Medical School Tuition Fees Hadeel Ali Ali Professor TJ Murray ENC 1102 February 26, 2017 3 Doctors need work ethic to give patients the help they need. Without work ethic there is no point in doing anything because the problem will come back if not ever solved in the first place. If doctors pay and hours are arranged by higher people who are not in the medicine field then they are left with little to no room to work on patients in certain ways where it may seem unethical to others. However, for people who have studied medicine know that new discoveries can work. So, when doctors cannot experiment and venture out for the health of the patients they most likely will stop caring and will not give their 100%. They may even go off to another field because they will not be able to make potential real. Helen Pavlov, radiologist in chief at the Hospital for Special Surgery, states in her article in the Huffington Post that is conceivable that those excellent, potential pre-med students may forgo graduate school and become (for example) an automobile mechanic instead of a physician. As an automobile mechanic, their income will start at a younger age, their hourly compensation may be greater, and a successful outcome of their diagnostic and technical efforts may be more appreciated than if they become Although free tuition sounds inviting the downfalls are too dire. Doctors need incentives to work ethically and have some autonomy in their careers. It is sad to think that money is this important to people but keep in mind that when doctors have leeway with their salaries and hours they are free to discover new ways to treat people. Diseases plague a large part of out population on earth and so when people who do not understand medicine and science and have power over what is done and not done can make science stay at a halt and not progress. Tuitions for medical school are incredibly high but instead of erasing it all at once tuitions should decrease gradually.
