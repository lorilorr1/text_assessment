Many of us have used one of those apps at least once today. Even you might be using your phone while you are reading this paper. If you are using them right now, you are really approving the idea that says social media has taken over the world and many of us cannot continue a day without using one of them. It becomes a daily routine that should be done like drinking a morning coffee. Many consider social media as a positive thing for people and their social life because it keeps them connected with people around them, especially for people who are working all the time and cannot find time for socializing. On the other hand, many believe a bad habit that may affect health and bring problems to people like addiction. Large numbers of people are using apps for very long hours and spend so much time on. People who cannot manage themselves in using those apps, scientists call them addicts. Some people have reached a very high level of addiction and this would consider as a big psychological problem that may bring issues into lives. Since technology took place in the world and people started to use social media platforms all the time. Many of them get addicted to it and cannot manage themselves. In this case, people should stop spending so much time on them by different ways like advising and controlling kids. For example, each parent should give his or her kid limit hours per day for using those apps. Al Ibrahim 2 Social media has been used from all people around the world and all ages not only teenagers. The chance to get addicted to social media is equal on all ages, which means there is no specific certain age that needs to be aware of its danger. All ages needs to get advised because all people who use them are able to get addicted and be in the danger of being distracted. According to Boyd, all people in society are able to be addicted and affected not only teenagers (21). Being addicted to it can bring many problems to people in different aspects. For example, it is going to distract students in classes and even while doing homework and school stuff. Boyd believes using social media in classes is not going to affect only the person who is using it also would affect who is around. Sometimes professors would ask the person to stop using his phone and pay attention, which will force professor to waste time and stop teaching in order to ask the person. Being addicted also could affect health and minds, which put users in more danger. The majority of people are unaware of the danger light that comes out from all devices because it brings several problems for eyes. The danger increases when use those devices in darkness because the device light will be the only source that both eyes will receive light from. This type of effects is very dangerous for humans because it show its consequences immediately. It takes humans long time to find out their eyes are getting affected unless they check up continuously. Doctors usually call this type of issues long-term effects. People usually receive sight issues and feel those problems when they become around 35 years and sometimes from 40 and above. Going back to the survey that MEMO has done around 30% of people in the world start to wear medical glasses at age of 36 and above. This survey is approving the idea of long-term effects Al Ibrahim 3 because most people use the devices for long hours when they are between 22-35 especially people whose work done through computers. Additionally, of us are unaware of the potential dangers of blue light emitted from light-emitting diode (LED) and compact fluorescent light (CFL) to (Smick, Kirk 32). People should be carful and aware about the danger of this new technology and its impact on human. All need to know how to use these devices in good way. It has been so clear that spending so many hours on social media is harmful for different aspects in our societies. According to Smick and Kirk, parents must take an action against the new addiction that makes very serious issue in societies (33). They state parents can reduce the usage of social media by limit the usage hours for their kids. For example, they can give the kid specific time to use iPads and Phones and limit usage hours that could be around three hours less or more. Moreover, warn kids about the danger of those devices on them and the consequences that could come from harmful lights. Furthermore, they believe to get this process done parents need to be educated about the effects of that harmful light on vision in order to advice their children. In our daily life, social media has become a routine and habit for all of us and sometime it becomes hard to continue a day without checking our devices continuously. It becomes rare to have a friend who use one of the platforms and none of us could spend a day without using any type of social media platforms. Those apps take a lot time from our days and distract all users while doing their important things like school or work stuff. Thoughts about social media have changed over time and majority of us around the entire world became using social media more than any time before which increases the chance of getting addicted to them and hard to limit themselves. In the Al Ibrahim 4 middle of all this issue people should take an action to reduce the usage by different ways. Advising could be one of the helpful actions that need to be done nowadays because now might be a little bet late to start advising and the reason is most of us cannot control themselves to avoid using those apps all the time.
