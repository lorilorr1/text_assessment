Student 1 Student Professor Lewis ENC 1102 12 April 2017 A Life of Hope A life full of happy days and positive smiles is a life almost everyone hopes to have. Unfortunately, a mental illness is preventing some people from achieving this life. Depression is defined as illness that involves the body, mood, and thoughts and that affects the way a person eats, sleeps, feels about himself or herself, and thinks about This mental illness must not be mistaken for the simple mood of for depression is more complex than a simple emotion. Depression can affect not only the person who is diagnosed with it, but also family members of the victim. It is not a genetic illness, so it could form at any given time to an individual. Imagine not being able to feel happiness no matter how hard one tries. Although it may appear to be as simple as a mood, depression is a serious illness that needs to be treated immediately because every person deserves to have a chance to feel happy. First and foremost, depression is not a newly developed mental illness. This illness has been around for thousands of years and first recognized in 400B.C. There is evidence in artwork, letters, diaries, and biographies from people all over the world. One example is severe melancholy or Samuel diary entries agonizing over his despondent moods Also back in 400 B.C., during the ancient Roman and Greek times, melancholia was the term used for depression. There is a vase available of Euripides on it appearing upset, history states that during those times he was depressed, Orestes, Euripides Student 2 depicts the protagonist as exhibiting many of the telltale symptoms of depression: loss of appetite, excess sleeping, lack of motivation to even bathe, constant weeping, chronic exhaustion, and a sense of helplessness This goes to prove that people have been dealing with this illness for over a long period of time and it is time to make a difference and preventing it from recurring. Another thing to understand is it is crucial that the general population is informed of what depression is and how it affects people. This mental illness does not just simply damage perspective but as well as internal organs. Depression alters the way the brain functions which then disrupts the regular function of organs. Systems that are affected include the cardiovascular system, the digestive system, the immune system, and the central nervous system (Pietrangelo). most recent studies exploring health and major depression have looked at patients with stroke or coronary artery (WebMd). Heart disease is one of the highest ranked causes of death in America, and depression could worsen a chance of developing heart disease. and anxiety disorders may affect heart rhythms, increase blood pressure, and alter blood clotting This illness increases levels of stress thus causing the blood pressure to rise as well as increased glucose which then shunts blood off from the digestive system to the brain. can affect the appetite. Some people cope by overeating or binging. This can lead to weight and obesity-related illnesses like type 2 diabetes This illness cannot be taken lightly for it affects so many bodily functions of a human that it could be fatal. Overall depression alters the way the brain functions which then undergoes a malfunction in the body physically and mentally. Although, one may be informed on what exactly depression is and how it affects someone, not much is being done to prevent it and treat it. There are still many recurring cases of Student 3 depression. is one of the most common mental disorders in the United States. In 2014, around 15.7 million adults age 18 or older in the U.S. had experienced at least one major depressive episode in the last year, which represented 6.7 percent of all American adults These numbers are fairly high and there are people in every city suffering from depression. In order to take a stance, the people not diagnosed with depression need to become more supportive of helping cope the illness for it is not a decision to develop depression. This illness occurs at any age, and could result in bullying which rapidly makes the things worse. Nobody wants to see children suffer or go through a tough childhood, and depression can eliminate life from having any source of happiness. With this illness, the brain alters the perspective of the victim into a gloomy and unhopeful one. An interview was taken with a 19-year old teen who has suffered from depression at the age 15 to get a better understanding on how one may feel that is suffering from it and establishing hope for others going through it. When asked how it felt like to live with this illness she responded, with myself during depression is the hardest thing for me to do. I can accept mistakes but mine. Everyone is beautiful but me. Everyone has something going for them but me. Everyone is in a great relationship but me Essentially, it is difficult to understand what exactly someone feels when suffering from this illness, but with the knowledge that it could be fatal should shift people into wanting to help. Even though this disease directly affect someone, action should still be taking place for those who are going through it. Anti-bullying campaigns are active at some schools and should proceed to go worldwide because children are being bullied every day for having depression which then leads to worse outcomes. In order to conquer the of depression being of the thus leading to loneliness, there must be no tolerance for bullying at Student 4 any school in America. By doing so, it will support more friendships during childhood rather than isolations. Personal issues are hard to avoid for they linger around the comfort zone of There needs to be free therapy for those who are suffering from depression and are in need. In public schools, there are plenty of guidance counselors to speak to; however, in the real world, health insurance must be at hand and if not then money shall be in order to speak to someone when undergoing depression. Money lures people away; it does not attract them into taking action to overcome their illness. Volunteering positions need to open up for the people in need before the illness gets worse and could have a drastic ending result. The world would be a happier place if everyone had someone to go to when they are in need for a listening ear. This could be beneficial to the individual suffering and the individual willing to give a listening ear. The individual with the illness now has a source of relief rather than living in a dark place and the individual with a listening ear is developing social skills, building a relationship, and making a difference in life. Human interaction is taken for granted, for it is the reason why there are issues, love, trauma, relationships, connections, emotions, problems and solutions. Overall, depression should not be overlooked because it is a possible fatal illness. This illness affects thousands of people all over the world and at all ages. Even though it may not directly affect someone at this given moment, the future is not clear and nobody is certain what it holds. Coming together as one to support one another will effectively increase the hope of one suffering from this illness to have a happy life and see the world from a brighter perspective. There are plenty of people in need of something, but the conscious of knowing that one has support at every corner for their depression will help them overcome it with a positive mindset. Although it may appear to be as simple as a mood, depression is a serious illness that needs to be treated immediately because every person deserves to have a chance to feel happy.
