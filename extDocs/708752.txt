The use of geothermal energy as a safe, efficient, ethical, and environmentally friendly alternative is gaining momentum in the scientific and general community. A geothermal well, which is used to generate power from heat, requires the presence of rock permeability and abundant water. According to the Geothermal Energy Association (GEA), hot water or steam is trapped in cracks and pores under a layer of impermeable rock, it forms a geothermal exploration of a geothermal reservoir for potential development includes exploratory drilling and testing for satisfactory conditions to produce useable (Geothermal Energy Association 7). With rain water and melting ice, these hot water systems are continuously being replenished, which makes the energy source continually available and renewable. With the simplistic and consistent means of gathering this harmless but powerful resource, as well as its efficiency, ethical standards, and overall safety, it is important to support efforts to strengthen its use. Fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas, and oil are time-tested failed means of energy sources used by humanity. The use of natural gas by means of fracking is dangerous. In an article by Sari Kovats and others, it has been found that exposures include outdoor air pollutants (i.e., volatile organic compounds, tropospheric ozone, and diesel particulate matter) Student 2 and pollutants (i.e., benzene, hydrocarbons, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, and heavy metals) in both ground and surface (Kovats et. Al). Specifically in the Keystone XL pipeline, which connects Canadian pipeline with United States refineries and ports, increases harmful greenhouse gases tremendously. It has been documented that net annual impact of Keystone XL could range from virtually none to 110 million tons CO2 equivalent annually. This spread is four times wider than found by the US State Department million tons (Erickson 1). With such dangerous consequences from using fossil fuels, it is important that new energy sources, such as geothermal energy, are promoted as primary sources of energy. With geothermal energy at large in some regions of the world, the amount of harmful pollutants in the atmosphere will steadily decrease over time. Geothermal wells are clean burning and will help to keep the environment safe. With water vapor being the simple, vital chemical in the geothermal energy harnessing process, people have nothing to fear in terms of their health and safety when advocating for this valuable resource. According to the Direct Utilization of Geothermal Energy 2010 Worldwide Review by John W. Lund and others, geothermal energy is accessible from all around the world, making it a prime suspect for a principal source of alternative energy. It is stated that (ground-source) heat pumps have the largest energy use and installed capacity worldwide, accounting for 70.95% of the installed capacity and 55.30% of the annual energy (Lund 6). This indicates that not only is geothermal energy widely accessible, it is achievable as a reliable energy source in the United States as well as the world. Another stakeholder that is invested in this endeavor, R. Curtis and others from the Proceedings World Geothermal Congress of 2005, has found that geothermal wells one of the fastest growing applications of renewable energy in the world, with annual increases of 10% in about 30 countries over the past 10 (Curtis 1). It has also been found that the main Student 3 advantage of this way of harnessing energy is that it utilizes normal groundwater temperatures that are available in all countries of the (Curtis 1). This is solid scientific support for the advancement of geothermal energy for the benefit of the human population, as well as the environment. The overuse of fossil fuels that has plagued the world has taken its victim and must be addressed as well the simplistic benefits of alternative energy. With harmful chemicals to the environment and to human and animal kind, it is appalling to consider how unfortunate circumstances have been created at the hands of unethical energy production practices. Thinking back to the 19-20 th century in the United States, where coal mining was a common and dangerous profession. Breathing in dangerous particles and chemicals from the coal mines caused the miners to develop a disease known as Coal Pneumoconiosis. This disease, as described by Joseph E. Martin, is a slowly debilitating disease that took the lives of many coal miners. It was noted that the of simple pneumoconiosis makes the lung liable to a more disabling and killing disease-progressive massive (Martin 582). This limits the maximum breathing capacity of the infected person, effectively causing them pain, shortness of breath, and difficulties related to oxygen deficiency. As a modern example, the continued development of fossil fuel use is contaminating drinking water fir many people, including many indigenous cultures. They are current victims of this unethical practice of gathering energy resources. According to an article by Lauren Carasik, 1,886km Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) would transport a half million barrels of fracked crude oil from the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota to Illinois, crossing multiple waterways including the Missouri River, that serves as the drinking water source for millions of (Carasik). This contamination of natural gas into drinking water makes it dirty, have higher metal Student 4 content, and can even make it flammable, according to the aforementioned source. Advocating for renewable alternative energy, especially geothermal energy, would prevent tragedies like this from happening again. Non-engaged stakeholders regarding this issue, including the general population and those who are engaged in non-scientific or academic fields, should care about promoting geothermal energy. This is because future generations are going to face the impending shortage and extinction of fossil fuel usage. This means that a reliable energy source should be more concretely established as soon as possible. It also has a great effect on the environment and plant, animal, and human welfare. In order to establish a world-wide or even nation-wide stance on the issue, an organization or movement needs to be erected. Marches, civil protests including petitioning), fundraisers, and information sessions are all great inclusive events that would spread awareness to the general population in order to gain momentum and make their voices heard. Even simple steps, like people talking to their friend and family or donating any amount of money to the cause, would greatly help in furthering research and innovation regarding the promotion of geothermal energy. Geothermal energy is an efficient, modern, and reasonable alternative energy source as opposed to other types of energy, mainly fossil fuels: oil, natural gas, and petroleum. This type of energy is widely accessible and clean-burning, which will help to protect the environment for future generations. The evidence in the paper, including that of the negative effects of fossil fuels, as well as how efficient and clean geothermal energy is, support the promotion of geothermal energy as a vital resource. Once message I have for any non-engages stakeholder, as well as a stakeholder that may harbor an opposing opinion is to consider their health, the health of their children, and the health of the environment. With leading research and development on Student 5 alternative energy sources, unclean, unhealthy, and overall dangerous forms of energy and its extraction can be eradicated from the modern world.
