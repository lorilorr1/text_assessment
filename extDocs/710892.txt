Student 1 Student Instructor Lewis ENC 1102 16 April 2017 Using the Sun to Sustain the Future For the first time in human history, our species has the opportunity to decide if we want to remain relatively ignorant to a world changing problem that affects everyone, or to choose a brighter path that could mean a greater future for all life on earth. There is one issue that universally affects all life on earth right now and that is climate change. Through the pumping of toxic carbon gasses into the air, carbon emitting factories have unknowingly set a timer on the sustainability of earth reserves of clean air. Despite the impressive size of this atmosphere, there is a limit to how much said atmosphere can hold before things become critical. With the sea level rising, the seasons acting more chaotic, and the air pollution seen in countries like China and India becoming an increasing problem, it is clear that the effects from burning these fossil fuels are nothing to be ignored (Sindu, Sonal, Nehra, Luthra). The solutions to these problems lay with the alternative energies such as wind, water, nuclear, and solar. The furthest developed and easiest to implement of the four alternative energies listed above is solar, and yet it still has to overcome tremendous obstacles. Though many companies have tried to limit or prevent the introduction of Solar technology into the market, it remains a growing industry due to the growing number of consumers interested in cheaper, cleaner, and more sustainable energy. In its early days, the fight for the expansion of solar energy was intrinsically tied with awareness campaigns for climate change. Since the industrial era began in the late the fossil fuel industry has had a rapid expansion into all energy markets, and now have almost Student 2 complete control of the output of power around the world. Until recently, Solar technology was incredibly inefficient and had no real-world practicality. The equipment failure rate was disproportionately high compared to other technology, and the electronic waste from broken solar cells rendered the environmentally friendly argument irrelevant (Caliskan, Hakan). This was combined with the inefficiency of the technology itself. Harnessing solar energy is a much more difficult job that it may seem on the surface. Considering that only a fraction of the suns energy that touches a solar cell can be captured, attaining the highest efficiency on the capturing of the suns energy was the first step (Psych, Mette, Glunz). By 2005 the technology had developed far enough to land in the eye, and in the early the US government got involved by beginning to fund solar initiatives. The private sector began picking up traction in the early with companies like and creating large PR moves to gain massive name recognition. The largest and most successful of all these solar power companies remains to be Solar City with its ambitions shareholder Elon Musk using his other companies to pave a bright future for the solar industry. Despite a potentially bright future on the horizon for solar technology, there are opposing firms who are making big plays to prevent a change from carbon based fuels. There is an unofficial oligopoly in the United Stated today, which it is made up of energy companies. Most power companies use defined regions to give the illusion that there is competition in the energy market place, while most people in the United Stated have only one choice of power company. In a free market economy like that of the US, this can only have been done using local city councils to legislate barriers of entry which are too unreasonable for other companies (Hassler, Krusell, Oloysson). This has also made the barrier of entry for Solar Power considerably higher as seen by the NV Energy vs Solar City conflict in Nevada several years ago. The primary counter Student 3 argument from these power companies for not wanting solar energy in their market has to do with supplying sufficient level of electricity to the power grid. If people began to use solar panels to provide a sizable percentage of their household energy demands, then a standard power company would be unable to accurately predict how much energy a region will draw, and thus will have to over produce to cover all scenarios. On a macro scale, the model becomes increasingly wasteful as more and more resources are wasted on a prediction rather than practical research. This argument, however, has just recently been shown to not be as accurate as previously thought. Though resource waste at power plants is high, there is more relief on the grid than harm from using solar panels (Abdi, Hamdi, Beigyand, Scala). The argument for solar energy begins to make sense on a consumer and personal level. Without any background information, and without believing in solar energy as a solution to climate change, solar panels still retain their appeal. This is due to the economic benefits of owning the technology such as tax incentives, reduced utility bill, and independence from a power company (Reboredo, Quintela, Otero). Though the personal benefits are great those educated on this specific environmental issue may find even greater benefits to buying solar panels. It is very important to remember the difference between a renewable and nonrenewable resource when discussing this topic. The coal and oil reserves on earth will run out eventually, and with that comes a need for a more sustainable power source. Solar energy is not limited by anything but exposure to solar rays, which mean that, in the long run, Solar power will still be useable once carbon based power becomes unusable (Koepf, Alxneit, Wieckert, Meier). Finally, the environmental efficiency of Solar technology should be enticing enough to convince even a climate change denier of its benefits. Pollution is a topic that needs no debate. Everyone agrees that these is an issue with dirty air that is unbreathable and must be filtered, and waterways Student 4 holding fluid that is killing wild life. The environmental efficiency of solar technology fixes that issue by taking strain from a power company, thus causing them to reduce their emissions (Wang, Zhaohua, Li, Zhimin). Carbon emissions effects everybody in the world. With rampant climate change, and growing pollution, every living creature on earth has a stake in this cause. That being said, it is the responsibility of China, India, and the United States to invest in solving the climate issue, because if these countries do not change their carbon producing ways, then smaller and poorer countries will not either (Sindu, Sonal, Nehra, Luthra). In India, water pollution from power plants and factories is so great that the rivers have become toxic and unusable. In some cities, the air is too thick to safely breath. This issue exists in China as well, and based on the increasing emission numbers from Larger Cities like Los Angeles, it seems likely that the United States may share India and fate. The problem with using solar energy as main solution to climate change is that spreading information through word of mouth is not enough. People will have to spend money to enact change or make a statement that is noticeable enough to gain the attention of the corporate executives of the energy companies which are resisting the technology (Dowling, Alexander, Zheng, Zavala. By purchasing a solar panel or investing in a solar company, people can show that is what consumers desire. Once multibillion dollar corporations begin investing in solar technology, that is when success will be imminent. From financial benefits to environmental benefits, solar technology is a worthwhile solution to many problems facing individuals, and the world. With rampant progress being made in breaking the energy lock that power companies have, it seems more likely every year that solar power will become a feasible reality. Every additional person who make the commitment to Student 5 purchasing a solar panel helps not only themselves, but their communities as well by doing their part in cleaning up the environment. Solar power is a great first step, but when it comes to climate change as a whole it is not enough. Everything from buying electric cars to recycling can add up, and make for a better future.
