Butterfield 1 Brittany Butterfield Ms. Heiser ENC 1102 069 1 February 2017 Sex Education Preteens across the nation are being taught a controversial curriculum called sexual education. Sexual education, known commonly as is the instruction on topics relating to human sexuality. The National Abstinence education association, ASCEND, is an organization that promotes the practice of abstinence-centered education. The abstinence education teaches the restraint of all sexual activities until marriage and stresses the morality of different forms of sexual expressions in teenagers. While some say, this is the best way to education children, the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States, SIECUS, has taken stands on educating children about sex to promote safer sex and decreases teen pregnancy. Despite the ongoing disagreement with the two, there is hope for a compromise. The national abstinence education association primary goal is to promote abstinence- only-until-marriage programs. This organization has strong religious views and perceives comprehensive sexual education as a factor that increases the likelihood of teens having sex at a young age. The council of this organization is comprised of united individuals who meet to discuss methods to further the abstinence-centered education field. ASCEND promotes adolescents to make healthy decisions in their relationships through sexual risk avoidance techniques. risk avoidance is an educational approach based on the public health model of primary prevention to empower youth to avoid all the risk of sexual (http://weascend.org). Through these techniques, teens feel liberated to continue to remain firm Butterfield 2 on their pledge of purity until marriage; thus, retaining adolescent pregnancy rates and transmission of sexually transmitted diseases in youth low. Predominantly in southern states, ideology is highly endorsed; Comprehensive sex education is customarily perceived as a gateway to sexual activity. In Tennessee, for example, stringent laws are implemented in secondary school that forbids presentations that do not exclusively encourage abstinence from sexual intercourse (Emmeline Zhao). In the article, negative: when my state passed one of the most rigid abstinence-only sex education laws in the nation, I went back to Becca Andrews explains how she benefited from the strict abstinence preaching. Andrews stated friends and I knew the consequences of sex: ruined reputations, questioned faith, and the most unthinkable of all, She believed being instructed about the advantages of abstinence helped push her to remain strong on her purity. Along with the abstinence-centered education, Andrews parents continually informed her that sex was only for reproduction. While this approach may seem futile, one, of many, positive outcomes of abstinence education is middle schoolers who were in an abstinence program were more likely to delay their first sexual (Benefits of abstinence) These positive reports aid to ASCEND underlying goal of furthering abstinence- centered education. Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States is an organization that actively advocates for comprehensive sex education. has the right to accurate information and age and developmentally appropriate education about (www.siecus.org).SIECUS believes that comprehensive sex education is a critical course of study that should be taught regardless of the cultural background of each child. Topics including, human development, sexual relationships, sexual expression and sexual health, are all taught. Butterfield 3 These topics are positively expressed, encouraging adolescents to be comfortable in their sexuality. In furtherance of ensuring accurate and respectful teachings, SIECUS has a training program for teachers. The teachers learn exactly how to present sexual education information and remain well up to date on emerging information. Consequently, adolescents become more prepared for when they choose to partake in sexual activities. Despite the numerous data that agrees with ideologies of comprehensive sexual education, parents still have some resistance on whether their child should be taught the material. In Hmong, American Views on Promoting Adolescent Sexual Laurie Meschke and Christina Peter overturn these opposing views. Meschke and Peter conducted a survey of two hundred parents, which gathered how they felt about furthering their sexual education. While a few agreed, they would like an abstinence-centered sex education they all agreed they wanted their child to remain healthy and encouraged sexual education topics to that avert teen pregnancy. This article entwines with SIECUS goal of decreasing teen pregnancy rate and sexual risks. This goal is illustrated in an article by Christine Markham et al, Behavioral and Psychosocial Effects of Two Middle School Sexual Health Education Programs at Tenth-Grade The article revealed that comprehensive sex education delayed sexual intercourse and reduced other sexual risks in ninth and tenth graders. This was uncovered through extensive studying of fifteen middle schools and the conduction of follow-up surveys of the same students that took the course previously. The students were asked how well the sex education was in reducing sexual risks, which all agreed that it played a great role in. This exemplified the importance of continuing the education in high school to increase the success rate of delay of sex and reduced sexual risk behaviors, which SIECUS stresses. Butterfield 4 As time has progressed, it is apparent that there needs to be a solution between the two forms of sexual education. A plausible solution is to implement abstinence-plus-education programs. Abstinence-plus-programs are a happy medium between the two because it includes information about contraception methods, along with strong abstinence preaching. Sexual activities is discussed in a positive manner while teaching methods to reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy and infections of STDS. Abstinence will also be taught in a positive manner, reassuring adolescents that this is the best method to avoid the havoc of unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. This proposal works because study showed that most students felt their abstinence-only sex education had mixed value and low overall impact in their lives. However, those that stressed in abstinence-only curricula and drew in themes with had themes with strong support for comprehensive instruction and less for emphases on strictly negative outcomes of sexual (Emily A. Gardner) The only way to guide adolescents is to have a sexual education with substance, material that provides information that would help if the inevitable happens and they partake in sexual activities. The different teaching of sexual education is a topic that has been discussed thoroughly. The National Abstinence Education Association and Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States intentions are to lower the rate of teen pregnancy and prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. Both focus is to education adolescences about the importance of life decisions, emotionally and physically. The effects of teen pregnancy on the mother and the family can leave damage for years to come. Butterfield 5 Work Cited We Ascend, weascend.org/about-us-2/. Andrews, Becca.
