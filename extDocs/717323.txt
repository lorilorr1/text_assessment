Although we are capable of accomplishing goals and satisfying our objectives, there are certain aspects that we may never be able to achieve due to our limitations as humans. However, the previously mentioned assistants would be able to progress us towards great accomplishments. This would come in the form of artificial intelligence or AI. AI is having machines wield knowledge on the level of humans; including aspects like: problem-solving, free-thinking, and emotions. The power inside of these machines can progress humanity on both a social and scientific level so advanced research towards would bring humanity great benefits. From a social standpoint, AI has already influenced the daily lives of individuals. Siri, an AI partner created by Apple Inc. has allowed from the collection of information such as names, locations, or even products from networks. This is not the first successful application of AI, a proto-AI known as Deep Blue in 1997 was created to be an AI chess machine which was capable of thinking and playing against various human opponents and was able to be utilized for future generations of chess (Makridakis 4-5). AI would not be limited to just these functions should advanced research be implemented.
