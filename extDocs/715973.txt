Per Debate.org many people feel as though the justice system does not stereotype blacks more than whites. They say that the black culture teaches African Americans that the justice system is out to get them and, that they are above the law when it comes to dealing with the authorities. They believe that Blacks are taught to be disrespectful as a sign of manhood, and that whites are the ones that truly face racism. Many went as far as to say that segregation is over, that if blacks feel as though they are being treated poorly they should go back to Africa. Another said that Blacks are treated exactly as they are supposed to be treated. They said if you have a high IQ and someone said, a car was stolen automatically assume the criminal was black. The reasoning behind why people feel the way they do is outrageous. How can you tell Blacks to go back to Africa when they were forced into slavery and brought to the U.S? Racism is alive and well and just because segregation was abolished does not mean people are right in their ways of thinking. If anything, Black culture teaches Blacks to be strong and stand up for their rights when dealing with authorities. Blacks mothers lecture them and are afraid to go Onwuanaibe 5 out because they are targeted by the justice system. Anyone who tries to argue that is not living in the real world! White people know fear, take a walk in an African Americans shoes and face the truth. The percentage of African Americans behind bars is greater than that of whites. African American youths hold a higher percentage within cell walls than they do in the general population. The irony is that in 2011, violent crime arrests by whites was 59.4%, and for blacks it was 38.3%, but whites represent 77.9% of population, black only 15.4%. For homicides that rate is 49.7% black, and 48% white (Debate.org). How is it that blacks commit less crimes and are arrested more frequently by authorities? This statistical evidence proves that African Americans are incarcerated more than whites. African Americans aged ten to seventeen comprise about 15% of their age group in the population, yet they represent about 25% of all juvenile arrests, 30% of referrals to juvenile court, 40% of all incarcerated juveniles and close to 60% of waivers to adult criminal (Crutchfield 17). Authorities have preconditioned biases to associate people of color with criminal activity and find them guilty of stricter charges when they are faced in court. The justice system has adapted to believing crime is perceived as a black  how the problem is addressed and the resulting punitiveness of the approach serve to exacerbate societal (Mauer 1). Crime should never be considered a black problem, Crime is defined as illegal act for which someone can be punished by the (Merriam Webster). Crime belongs to everyone, and is not designated to a specific group based on physical appearance and societal views. Many believe that the reason crime is associated with blacks is because black authorities such as pastors, civil rights leaders, and parents encourage disrespectfulness and that it comes with tragic results and creates an inability to function in Onwuanaibe 6 society (Debate.org). The justice system poses unfair bias against blacks not because they commit crimes, but because black have been stereotyped with criminal activity. figures are well known, but shocking nonetheless: one of every eight black males in the 25-34 age group is locked up on any given day and 32% of black males born today can expect to spend time in a state or federal prison if current trends (Mauer 2). Another factor that proves the unfair stereotyping of blacks is unfair trials and convictions between blacks and whites. The amount of crimes being committed by these two groups does not line up with their sentencing and punishments. Many would say that blacks commit more serious crimes but this is not true, statistically, black people are more likely to be sent to jail than white people, but they are also more likely to commit petty crimes. youths, however, had higher rates of substance use than did African American youths. Reported drug-selling activity was also more common among Whites than among African American youths; this racial difference was statistically (Kakade et al 9). Even knowing this Blacks still get arrested more frequently than whites. This stems from problems with our justice system and corrupt cops and will continue it cycle if nothing is done to stop it. So the question does the justice system stereotype blacks more than whites? Considering that blacks hold a higher count behind bars then within the population, are stereotyped with all crime and face unfair trials and convictions it is evident that they do. The justice system has undermined the black community for years and created a perpetuating cycle that has allowed for blacks to become the scapegoat for crime.
