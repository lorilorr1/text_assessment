Reneta Simeon Professor Sarah Roth ENC 1101 April 9 th , 2017 Effectiveness of the War on Drugs Over the past three decades, the U.S. on first declared by President Ronald Reagan, has failed to accomplish its primary mission to discourage and eliminate the production, sale, and use of illicit substances such as cocaine(crack), methamphetamines, inhalants, marijuana, or any other substance used nonmedically to create a high or feeling of euphoria. Drug sales, use, and deaths were rising rapidly in the 1980s as drugs became a symbol of and (Drug Policy Alliance). The United States went on the offensive to alleviate the drug problem being faced by the nation and since then has made minimal, if any, steps towards reducing the problem. Despite endless government initiatives, programs and policies implemented, an increased number of people have reported use of illicit substances. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 was passed to established the Office of National Drug Control Policy. The ONDCP was created to help establish policies and programs to reduce illicit drug use, manufacturing, and trafficking. This office was also meant to alleviate drug-related crime and violence as well as drug-related health consequences and policy. In 2014, The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) Report published that 24.6 million Americans aged 12 and older admitted to using some form of alcohol or illicit substance within the past 30 days (SAMHSA 2014). Drug use increased to 9.4 percent of the population in 2014 from being approximately 8.2 percent just a few years prior (SAMHSA 2014). There has been an overall increase in drug statistics in the past 30 years despite the aggressiveness towards illicit substances. In addition to failed government initiatives, increased spending on law enforcement and drug possession arrests have caused more people to be arrested while drug use remains exceptionally high. In the 2000s alone, U.S. federal law enforcement spent over $4 billion per year arresting millions of people on marijuana charges, usually on mere charges of possession (Bourgois 581). Drug war policies have dominated the federal budget for decades. In 2015, roughly 55 percent of the annual federal budget was to policies that attempt to reduce the supply of drugs, such as interdiction, eradication and domestic law with less money spent on treatment, education, and prevention (Drug Policy Alliance). Years of increased spending on drug law enforcement have consistently proved to be unsuccessful yet every U.S. government administration in the past 30 years has continued the same path. Under the 1990s Bush administration, the United States witnessed the start of the of domestic drug law because there was an increase in drug related fatalities nationally (Drug Policy Alliance). Approximately 40,000 military-style SWAT raids were performed under his leadership, often for simple misdemeanors. Along with the militarization of law enforcement came a rhetoric that affected all crimes rather than just drug-related offences (Patten 85). According to a 1991 report published by the U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics, there was a 115.4 percent increase in the number of people arrested for drug charges from 1981 to 1990. There was also a 300 percent increase in overall incarceration rates in the United States from 1980-2000 that lead brought the country in the lead in incarcerations worldwide (Patten). Increased incarcerations has also proven to be insufficient to reduce drug use statistics. Zero-tolerance laws, alcohol taxes, ad other such programs have had no positive effects on college students. They have yet to warrant a decrease in drug or alcohol use from college students (Hingson et. al). In recent years, our society has witnessed the opposite effect: an increase in the use of illicit drugs and substances on college campuses across the nation. From 1999 to 2002, the proportion of college student 18-24 years old who had consumed 5 or more drinks on a single occasion in the past 30 days increased from 41.7 percent to 43.2 percent (Hingson et. al 256). We have gotten to a point where the stigma of is expected in college but most fail to realize that the problem is bigger than that. From 1998 to 2001, there was a 6 percent increase in alcohol-related deaths per college population (Hingson et. al 259). That translates to young adults ages 18 to 24, with barely a foot in the world, losing their lives before they even get a chance at living. Some may argue, that to some extent, the on has caused an overall improvement on the quality of life in the United States. Recent polls have shown that there has been an increase in the number of people who view drugs as a major problem in our society. In the 1980s, only 24 percent of the population viewed drugs as a major issue in the nation but a recent poll showed that that number had risen to about 60 percent. With increased awareness of the problem also comes more people trying to find a solution. The partial decriminalization of marijuana in a few states in the past few years also highlights the success of the on It has brought on a partial decriminalization of marijuana to ease the number of people being incarcerated on charges of mere marijuana possession (Drug Sense). Over 50 percent of the American population now supports the legalization of marijuana (American Civil Liberties Union). The on has become an issue of criminal justice and money. It lacks focus on the health issues related with the use and abuse of illicit substances. Although the country is no longer in political hysteria about drug abuse, there still is a long way to go until the drug reform is no longer needed. Sending individuals to jail for drug use is only making the country suffer more and need more help. It is not making us any safer or better off, as proven by years of statistics. We know that criminalization does not work and it is time to change the way we approach this major societal issue. time we treated people struggling with drug misuse the way want to help a family member struggling with addiction to alcohol or other drugs: by using what (Drug Alliance Policy).
