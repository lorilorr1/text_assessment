The issue began long time ago mainly because of the lack in advancement in the medical and technological fields that helps ease the operation. However, with the empowered revolution of the medical science it is now ideal for women in favor of reducing multiple health risks and more freedom in the matter of decision making. In other words, abortion eventually improves healthcare, economical standards, and college graduations. Besides, it reduces the chances of being a single parent. In regards to the above, abortion should be legalized globally taking all facts into consideration in order to grant women, the other half of the society, better healthcare and freedom of choice. Some people face abortion with a different view, for instance, they believe that the mother faces a heavy grief after banishing away her un-born baby. Likewise, others approach abortion as a of en-quality and fighting for the rights of the un-born babies is their main emphasis. In other words, the ideology revolves around the difference between the born and the unborn is their weight or size. Besides, religious beliefs and tradition views also may interfere with the idea of abortion. Furthermore, abortion is perceived abortion as immoral and unfair for the fetus that is the un-born who have done no mistake. On a different angle, abortion can cost a lot of money and can result in consuming a high financial percentage of a income. In this case, developing society with access to abortion used to provide abortion under riskier environments that consist of many doctors with no certificates to do such operation. This has caused thousands of deaths over the years which makes a serious catastrophe. Accordingly, is highly significant that depictions of foetocentric grief has increased and more women have been addressed as subjects of choice and capacity rather than bearers of a maternal (Millar, 2017). Foetocentric grief meaning that women that go through abortion face a period of sadness and grief as a result from giving away their sons considering their position as the responsible mother. Also, the quote encourages to look at women as a human rather than a birth machine. Shift in research in regards to abortion is reaching its peak exploring different areas that improved the circumstances that the operation goes through. There is a clear advancement in the medical field and technology in comparison to couple of years back. Abortion now take safety measures very carefully with accessibility within most societies. Furthermore, evidence prove that with abortion being more accessible it reflects positively resulting in an increased number of college graduations, fewer rates of single parenting, and lower usage of welfare referring to research in 2009. Additionally, in her findings it shows evidence suggest that improved living circumstances experienced by the average child born after the legalization of abortion had a lasting impact on the lifelong prospects of these (Ananat, 2009). Meaning that abortion not only helped by the mentioned previously but also it improves the living standards for new born babies. In the case of not having easy access to abortion, it will crucially affect some of these babies with struggling parents that may get separated eventually; therefore, putting the life in an un-suitable position due to lack of support. Women as a respected individual of the society should have the right to make the decision of abortion. Many political movements for and against abortion still exist since long time ago. However, in this case it is urged that women are the ones responsible of the decision- making. As the pregnancy is considerably a family matter it should stay in the family. In a case of Roe versus Wade where abortion was restricted unless the life was at risk. Obliged by the supreme court, the court that held the trail in Texas concluded that the constitutional rights protected a right to decide her pregnancy. This marks a stepping stone for abortion to board legally across most of the states taking in consideration the damage done to the concerned party that is the family. According to the article by Erdman best, the Court admits that the regulation of abortion and more broadly, the decision to become a parent or not may engage an individual right to for private and family (Erdman, 2016). This helps improving both physical and mental health. Many women would appreciate the opportunity of abortion in certain circumstances. For example, many of those mothers are still young and want to stop their career whether it is schooling or similar and others facing financial struggles. Also, it could prevent unwanted outcomes of immoral acts such as rape. Besides, it grants women the freedom that they deserve to control their future whether if she is capable of providing the support needed in order to have the pregnancy or to go through abortion if desired. Therefore, abortion improves living standards and prevents un-planned parenthood in which many children go through difficult stages of life lacking support. In conclusion, abortion improves the societal economical standards if women were to be free determining pregnancies. In addition, it also reduces risk of potential poverty. Thus, abortion should be legalized on a global level. Fighting for the right of women whether to go through abortion or not varies from a case to another. Because of that reason, women are the most rightful to determine her pregnancy. Putting our hands together to insure our mothers, sisters, and daughters lives have the outmost healthcare and a better future is crucially urgent.
