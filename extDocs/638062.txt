Caskey1 Cayla Caskey Ms. Theo ENC1102 January 29, 2017 Standardized Testing Standardized testing has been split into two sides, one being people or organizations that are striving to get rid of standardized testing and the other side which is fighting to keep standardized testing. Time Out from Testing is an organization that is trying to have standardized tests stopped because of the high impact that they have on children and their abilities to get a good education. State Collaborative on Reforming Education (SCORE) is an organization that fights to keep standardized testing stating that purpose of testing kids is to see what they (Aycock). A great amount of effort and thought has been put into standardized testing and how it should be handled in the United States, obviously having two different courses of action there must be similarities, one of these being the same end goal. Both of these organizations are trying to find the best course for success of students, this can be done by the organizations working together and altering the test to appease both sides. Time Out from Testing is an organization that is in the fight to get rid of the high stake standardized testing. Their mission statement is; call for a comprehensive review of the Regents exams and state-initiated standardized tests and the impact they have had on our children, our schools, and our (Time Out from Testing). This organization has been around since 1996, It was founded by Richard Mills an Education Commissioner. They have put a large amount of pressure on the New York public schools to change their methods in standardized testing. Many high schools tend to brush past the reality that there are multiple Caskey2 factors that go into a success on these high staked tests. Many teachers go along with the common myth that past teachers have not prepared their students well enough to continue onto the next grade, or course and so on. Past teachers, or ability to learn information for these assessments may not be the issue but the test itself. Studies show that high stake testing that is declining the number of students who move on from one grade to the next, or from middle school to high school, and even declines the graduation rates (Time Out from Testing). In 2006 only 64% of students in New York State graduated due to the fact that they did not score well on the high stake, standardized tests (Time Out from Testing). There are many other people who agree that these standardized tests need to be reviewed, altered, or completely gotten rid of. Though this organization and many other want to get rid of the standardized testing, many agree that some form of testing needs to be down to record a academic success and achievement. The other side of this argument are the organizations and people that are in support of standardized testing. One of these organizations being SCORE which has three main goals listed on their website, those are; continues to be among the fastest-improving states in the country and ranks in the top half of all states in student achievement as measured by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) by 2020. Tennessee closes all student achievement gaps at every grade level and subject area by income, race, geographic location, and student need. These gaps should be narrowing on both state and national assessments by 2020. Every Tennessee student graduates from high school prepared for postsecondary education and the (tnscore). This organization works to improve student success and have high expectations of students, expecting them to perform well on this testing style. This organization actually goes out into the world and works hand in hand with students to help them find the best Caskey3 way to succeed on these tests. This organization suggests the idea that all tests are this is why they believe that teachers themselves should not be able to make their own tests, because every teacher writes their tests in a different way (tnscore). Another argument that they make in favor of standardized testing that it takes away discrimination because every test is the same. A complaint that is commonly brought up in a classroom is that the teacher has to alter their teaching style and the material that they are trying to teach to this one high stake test, this organization believes that problem is not the teaching to the test. The problem is the Teaching to a test that is multiple choice is setting the success of students too low, that the test needs to be changed to set the bar higher for the students, also that the teachers maybe are not preparing their students enough to be able to achieve what they need to for these tests. Though these sides are very different in their beliefs of how the situation of student success should be handled they agree to the same end goal. Both sides want the greatest and most success of students. Graduation rates due to failure of standardized testing is too low for these organizations. Standardized testing is the primary source of testing a intelligence and knowledge, it has very high stakes, like a ability to graduate high school or to get into their college of choice. A student could have a good GPA and be a poor test taker, where does that leave them? In a sticky situation, both organizations want to find a solution to this problem. Standardized testing has been used in the United States since the 1930s (McMahon). The testing system is flawed and both sides agree on this consensus and agree change needs to be made but so not know the best course of action. Standardized testing is based off of seventh-century European psychology research (McMahon). A compromise on this issue could be creating a new test that is based off of recent psychological research in respect to education. Research has shown that students perform better Caskey4 in a familiar environment. This could be achieved by creating a test that allows all students to take the same test, but it is separated among the classes that they are used to with the teacher that they actually have. For example, when a high school student takes an ACT of SAT they must travel to a different school or possibly their own, but are in a large room with people they are unfamiliar with, and teacher or proctor that they do not know, this causes anxiety and distress. Also by decreasing the number of standardized testing can increase the success of a student (Bell 11). By decreasing the number of standardized the number of tests given has been successful in Finland, in Finland students take up to only three standardized tests throughout their entire career as a student (Bell 12). This could be very beneficial to the United States in the way that we deal with Standardized Testing. This would take time to achieve by slowly cutting down the number of tests this benefits both sides of the argument, but also the two sides exactly get their way completely. This would help the two organizations to ensure the success of students. Time Out from Testing would benefit by cutting away at the number of tests required of students, and this also benefits SCORE because standardized testing would still have a place, there just would not be as many of the tests. This also gives teachers more range for teaching, allowing them to teach their students what they think is necessary knowledge while allowing more time and gained knowledge before the test is taken. Also this decreases the blame factor on one teacher being responsible for a failure or success. Each organization has different views on high- stake standardized testing, one side does not want high- staked standardized testing and even fights it, whereas the other side fights to keep standardized testing and its fairness. Both sides believe in an end goal of growth of success in students in their journey through their education. Neither side truly agrees that our system is perfect and in that case a compromise could be made. The most reasonable and feasible Caskey5 compromise would be to decrease the number of standardized tests given to a student. In other places in the world such as Finland students are given up to three test their entire school career, and their education is ranked much higher than the United States. This also is based off of recent research done in the United States, so why not follow the research found in this country. This helps the situation by appeasing both sides to an extent, they both get their way. (wc1447) Caskey6 Work Cited Aycock, James. Teacher Voice: In Defense of Standardized  SCORE. N.p., n.d.
