Yates 1 Evan Yates Professor Carter ENC1102-034 29 January 2017 Should the U.S. Employ Nuclear Energy for Civilian Use? Since the U.S began utilizing nuclear power to provide electricity for its citizens post WWII, it has spawned controversy. Concerns with safety and efficiency of nuclear reactors, with the prospect of alternative fuel sources, collide with proponents of the method. This is a global issue, but for the interest of narrowing the problem, we will focus on just the U.S.; and talk mainly about the World Nuclear Association and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament as the proponents and critics of harnessing nuclear energy, respectively. These stakeholders have very different ideas about harnessing nuclear energy, but they share some common ground in that both entities care about the environment, human life, and providing a viable source of energy for U.S. citizens. Implementing policy placing stricter safety regulations on nuclear reactors could be a possible middle ground for advocates of nuclear energy, such as the World Nuclear Association, and critics of the method, such as the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.
