Large franchises may be found everywhere in these times, ranging from gas stations to convenience stores. A franchise defined as, a large business that has multiple international locations as well as available stock for purchase. Large franchises are monopolizing business industries by establishing multiple locations within a limited area, preventing small businesses from flourishing, this can easily be remedied by limiting the expansion of large franchises in each state. By doing so, local businesses will be able to flourish and reinvigorate the local economies by keeping many products on a local level. One of the largest issues with small businesses is that business has neither debt nor stock traded in organized (Ang, 2). This is an issue due to a lack of credibility, in market the view that the larger the stock of a company and the greater the price of said stock, the greater said success is appears rather frequently. Through this, unless through word of mouth from a trusted acquaintance, friend, or family member, the view on small local businesses is one of being unsuccessful or new and inexperienced. In some cases, this is the case, however, overall this is not the case. Most local business are successful in their own area, enough to continue and eventually expand. With the eventual expansion of said small businesses, monopolies are prevented. A monopoly defined as, the occasion in which a single entity of group entity control the sales of a product of service. Although it may be claimed that the large franchises do not hold a monopoly over any product, it is argued that through the grouping of large franchises, such as Costco and Club, monopolies are made over certain services, in this case being wholesale services. Some such scenarios being when the exercising monopoly power over the small (Ang, 4) rather than the large franchises. To successfully limit the large franchises in states, would be a costly endeavor that would should little to no initial return. To successfully limit large franchises, the current locations of these franchise locations must be changed or the area around these locations must be changed. This would have to include the purchase of the property, changing the preexisting city structure plan, and the relocation of existing buildings, and the possible job loss from the change in businesses in the area. Before, small businesses were protected from the international market, however, local businesses are threatened by international competitors penetrating formerly protected domestic (Etemad, 1999a, p. 91). This is, in part, due to the continued international expansion of the large franchises. The survival rate of small businesses decrease greatly due to the presence of large franchises, as Deller mentions that survival rates vary significantly by birth year, and new businesses in rural communities tend to have higher survival rates than those in urban (Deller, 1). Thus, limiting the expansion of large franchises is necessary and should be done on a state by state basis. The state by state is primarily needed due to the differing size and population density of each state as well as the tourist activity of each state, to mention some of the more important of the many reasons. For example, Florida would have greater tourist activity than Iowa. Also, a factor for consideration is the taxes on the property, both on purchase and after. Ang mentions when comparing small businesses to large businesses that tax considerations and the lack of market valuation could affect the type of financial decisions made [by small (Ang, 7). To consider all options, large franchises compared to small businesses are in a much more advantageous position. As is often said, rich keep getting richer, and the poor keep getting This just goes on to further demonstrate the advantage of start-up capital, which small businesses are rarely able to acquire and later pay back. need to alter the available locations for large franchises to allow for greater flourishing of small businesses and through this, reinvigorate the local economy.
