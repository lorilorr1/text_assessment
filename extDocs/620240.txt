Geisler 1 Alison Geisler Professor Fennell Composition II 29 January 2017 Should Criminals be Employed In the world we live in today, it is not rare to come across one who has been charged for a crime. Unfortunately, overpopulation of jails results in convicts being dismissed on a less of a sentence to make room for those who commit heavier crimes. Criminals who were convicted have difficulty finding employment due to their past record, which in turn leads them back to a life of crime because they have no other options. In order for one to be released in hopes of no return, he/she will need to complete a rehabilitation program overseen by a correctional officer for as long as necessary before they are sent out. Once dismissed, their record will show that they have completed the program successfully and they will be able to be involved in day to day work related activities without any complications. As a criminal, emphasis is placed on their past which restricts them from opportunities they may want to pursue such as employment. Regardless of circumstances criminals were raised in, they may not know any better ways to live, so they turn towards what they know best. An implemented rehabilitation program before one exists prison would best improve the way one sees life so that they can one day be successful. their time in jail one is able to take correctional programs which teaches them skills so that they are valuable in the workforce upon their release. These programs have been proven to reduce violence and stop recurring violence. Still, these incarcerated adults face employment difficulties (Davis, Bozick, Steele, Saunders & Geisler 2 Miles, 2013 (Abrams & Lea, 2016)). The undeniable truth is that as soon as one is convicted of a crime, their chance of future employment declines due to potential danger to others. On the other hand, employers in each workplace have difficulty finding workers, but hiring past criminals is less likely to happen. When one hires an ex-criminal it put not only their business at risk, but the others employees at that business and the customers coming into the business, they then become liable for these criminals. Throughout the course of the hiring process, when a business gets a resume, which is then put through a system, it then pulls up their criminal record and if it passes, what they allow, it will then look at their qualifications relevant to the job. Research has gone in depth to state that criminals, once hired have a greater chance of excelling within the business (Yadoo, 2016). The two sides to this situation have very different perspectives on the issue. Fortunately, if a criminal is able to get into an area with better conditions, they are more likely to have people help them out and employ them, otherwise they could continue to struggle and go back to committing crimes. In order to reach common ground the employer and criminal need to have an understanding of what it is like to be convicted and rehabilitated for the betterment of the individual. It is usually difficult for one side to see the other because they want it to be that one specific way. That is, the criminals see that they can not get a job because of their record but they do not understand why their qualifications will not help them out. Then, on the other hand, employers see the criminals as a liability to the company, other employees and the customers and they are taking a risk by hiring someone that may be more temporary than someone who has never been in jail (Tsai & Rosenheck, 2016). The issue comes in when one side chooses not to compromise or respect the decision of the other side although it may be valid. In turn, there is Geisler 3 often very little cooperation between stakeholders which results in hardships for unwanted ex-convicts. Between the two sides, if they choose to work with one another, the business will be able to grow and may later help out other criminals and then the criminal will have a leg up in society where he/she will be able to get better jobs over time because they put in the hard work and effort to get to that point (Cantora, Mellow & Schlager, 2016). Relating back to the idea of a perfect world where businesses will hire criminals and then criminals will be able to find a job without a problem, this is where the compromise comes into place. As stated earlier, before a criminal is released back into society successfully, he/she needs to complete a rehabilitation program. This program consists of those who have been on the streets their whole life, without much purpose and learning how to be a part of society which means working in a successful business which would have a regular salary. Not only would it be for those types of people but also ones who just want to relearn how to be apart of society because they have been away from it for so long. They will be taught basic social skills, different business skills, and ways to cope when they reach a situation they do not know how to deal with (Tsai & Rosenheck, 2016). Alongside, their correctional officer will not be there to punish but encourage, there will be no predetermined time in this program but until one thinks they have completed it successfully will it then be on their record that they would be able to work in any minimum wage business without a problem. Even though employers will still look at them as criminals, if this program is successful enough it could give them another chance and hopefully business will recognize that and give them the chance they deserve. There will never be a perfect world but if enough effort is put into this, everyone could have a second chance, although there may not be more than a second if something does end up Geisler 4 happening, it is the thought that counts and pushes these individuals to be the best that they can be. Criminal records will always be apart of one but if he/she can get past it, then they can hopefully be of help to the society and be able to feel as normal of a human being as possible.
