Agudelo 1 Maria Agudelo Andrew DeCarion ENC 1102 January 29, 2015 The Ethical and Moral Controversy of Euthanasia. Currently, euthanasia is considered a criminal offense in all but six states in the United States. The topic of has been extremely controversial the past few years and as of today, there are no federal laws prohibiting the practice of euthanasia in the United States. According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, euthanasia is defined as the act or practice of killing or permitting the death of hopelessly sick or injured individuals in relatively painless way for reasons for mercy. As well as with any other controversial topic, there are always people and organizations who are either for or against it. The Death with Dignity National Center and the Disability Rights Education & Defense Fund are two organizations that are dedicated to raise awareness about euthanasia; whether that is positive or negative. Both of these organizations are fighting for a common goal which is to provide terminally ill patients with comfort; whether that is by providing them with the means to die by giving them euthanasia or attempting to provide these patients with a comfortable remainder of their lives. In order to reach a common goal, both of these organizations will have to compromise some of their personal believes and attempt to work together. The Death with Dignity National Center is a nonprofit organization that expands the freedom of all qualified terminally ill Americans to make their own end-of-life decisions, including how they die Us: Death with Dignity National n.p.). This organization Agudelo 2 was founded in 1993, with the goal to define an effective policy such as the Oregon Death with Dignity Act (ODDA) that was established later in 1994, and to defend it against legal challenges, both in state and federal court Death with Dignity National n.p.). The ODDA has allowed terminally ill patients from the state of Oregon to make their own end-of-life decisions since it was first put in place in 1994 (Norton and Miller n.p.). According to Norton and Miller, ending your own life by using euthanasia is not a simple process because it takes several different factors into consideration. Some of them are the values, their family and friends, as well as weighing the options; which in this case would be to end their life or if offered to continue to undergo treatment for their illness. The hospice social workers are another factor considered in this process, because after all they would be the ones aiding the patient to end their life. The Death with Dignity National Center, has focused on expanding throughout the country to get the Death with Dignity Acts passed in each individual state. Since 2004, they have accomplished the policy reform in states such as Washington and Vermont. On the other hand, there are organizations such as the Disability Rights Education & Defense Fund who focuses on advancing the civil and human rights of people with disabilities. Their missions is just world where all people, with and without disabilities, live full and independent lives free of Us: n.p.). The Disability Rights Education & Defense Fund have been advocating against euthanasia and assisted suicide since the early They believe that the legalization of euthanasia and assisted suicide are big mistakes, because it is influenced by other factors such as the health care and the government. Although they believe that the wishes of the patient should be fulfilled as much as possible, this particular wish is a danger to society, because of its multiple harmful consequences Suicide Laws: n.p.). RB Miller, states in his article that when Agudelo 3 someone with is diagnosed with disability or a terminal illness their whole life changes, which means that their mental state will be affected as well. Therefore, it is difficult to determine if they are capable of making autonomous decisions when it comes to ending their life. After reviewing both organizations, it is clear that they have a goal in common and that is to protect the rights and dignity of people with disabilities and terminal illnesses. It is proposed that both organizations come to a compromise that benefits both as well as all the Americans with terminal illnesses and disabilities. According to Stefan Eriksson and colleagues, euthanasia and assisted suicide might be against the best interests. Autonomy is something that must be respected, but claiming autonomy when it comes to euthanasia or physician assisted suicide is something that can only be determined on a case by case basis (Eriksson n.p.). Since both interests lie in the rights, a proposed compromise would be to create a task force of psychiatrists, and judges. This task force would reunite and create a series of guidelines which include circumstances under which euthanasia could be a possibility for the patient. The guidelines created by the task force would then be approved by the government and enforced in all the states. If the patient disagrees with the guidelines and insists on being able to use euthanasia to end his or her life, then the patient would have the right to petition the court and make a case. I am a firm believer in this solution, because after all if the guidelines are clearly described then there would be diseases and illnesses in which the patients suffer severely that would allow euthanasia, but others in which the illness does not cause any physical or mental distress on the patient where it would not be allowed. The prohibition of euthanasia is something that appears to provide no greater solution, because if a patient is truly determined to end their life they will travel to other states or even countries where it is legalized (Smith n.p.). Agudelo 4 Building upon finding this common ground between these organizations, could potentially lead the way for other organizations who have common interests but are fighting for different causes to come together. At the end of the day, both organizations care about the rights, and their quality of life; therefore, it is important for them to look past other issues and think about the patient and their mental and physical state. By legalizing euthanasia with the guidelines proposed, it would prevent the abuse of this method, but as well allow those who truly believe they need it to utilize it.
