All people deserve the right to attain medical attention without worrying about if they can afford to be healthy. As many as 37 million Americans lack adequate insurance against health care cost, and many others who have insurance still dread the financial impact of a serious disease. The current healthcare system is lacking the ability to cover all socioeconomic classes and this has led to many Americans not receiving medical attention. All Americans deserve the right of medical attention but unfortunately many cannot due to expensive monthly premiums. Recently under the Obama administration the Affordable Care Act was enacted but still many Americans could not receive healthcare. There are a multitude of organizations that strive to assist the American people in enrolling in healthcare. Enroll America is an organization that constantly works to enroll Americans in healthcare under the Affordable Care Act. The United States is currently in the middle of a healthcare transition. Universal healthcare in the US is in the progress but has a multitude of challengers like the insurance companies who still want to gain profit. Universal healthcare is achievable and can be very successful in the United States. The United States is lacking a healthcare system that is unified and can be effective for the population as a whole including all socioeconomic statuses. Lower income people are struggling to receive healthcare due to the extreme monthly premiums that insurance corporations charge but many organizations are assisting people in finding the perfect Zakhary 2 plan that can fit into their budget. Enroll America is an organization Enroll America, is an organization that is committed to maximizing, educating, protecting, and ensuring the population of the United States. Countries like Sweden, Germany, and Japan have constructed healthcare plans that covers all its citizens while providing them with very low monthly premiums. Enroll America strives to maximize the number of Americans who retain and enroll in any type of health coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Enroll America believes that everyone deserves healthcare that can cover them and is affordable for all socioeconomic classes. Enroll America is a volunteer based organization that aims at enrolling people in the US in a healthcare plan that is best suitable for them. Enroll America describes their vision as, America works with more than 6,700 partners in all 50 states and the District of Columbia to create cutting-edge tools, analyze data, inform policy, and share best practices in service of its mission: maximizing the number of Americans who enroll in and retain health coverage under the Affordable Care Act (Enroll Enroll America works under the Affordable Care Act to provide healthcare for all socioeconomic classes. Many health coverage plans today are extremely expensive especially for low-income households. Enroll America works with a multitude of organizations to ensure more people with healthcare. The United States health care system has improved over the past decade but still is lacking its full ability. Unlike other countries around the world who have one uniform and universal health care for the whole population, the United States does not have one uniform health care plan but multiple. In countries like Switzerland and Germany healthcare is universal and covers everyone but in the Unites States nearly 10.4% of the population still lack health care (FiveThirtyEight). Although within the past decade the US government has put in plans like ObamaCare that has opened healthcare up to everyone it still needs some improvement to cover Zakhary 3 the general population rather than low-income households. The United States has so much potential and the ability to create a health care plan that covers the whole population and that can be effective for all socioeconomic classes. If the more volunteers join the movement in enrolling people all around the Unite States they will have a greater effect in enrolling more Americans while working towards their individual goals. The idea of Universal and affordable healthcare for all socioeconomic classes is possible in America and can be achieved if fellow people in the US go out and volunteer to work together to achieve the main goal of providing security and health coverage to all Americans.
