Pittard !1 Tani Pittard January 29, 2017 Captive animals can be found in different and theme parks from all around the world. SeaWorld happens to hold the largest known number of captive animals in any theme park in the North American continent (1). This makes the company a huge target for PETA to attack on animal rights issues. If PETA could have it their way, there would be no SeaWorld and all animals would roam free in their natural habitats. This may not be such a good thing seeing as research has shown that the animals are not treated poorly at SeaWorld. It follows that many of these animals in captivity are rescues and otherwise could not survive in the wild. Thus showing that SeaWorld is helping these animals rather than hurting them. If SeaWorld could put more money into the animals habitats and general health they would benefit by making more profit, while PETA would benefit because the animals would then be safer and happier, and healthier. SeaWorld and PETA have a lot of differences in opinion, to say the least. To begin, SeaWorld is first and foremost, a company. In order to keep a company running, the said company must make enough revenue each year. For SeaWorld specifically, this profit is made by guess coming to visit the parks. The animals in the park are a big reason as to why many of the visitors pay to come. Whether guests come to watch the animals strictly for enjoyment, or to learn about them, they are coming to see the animals. For this reason, if the animals were to just disappear SeaWorld would lose a lot of income. PETA, however, is much more focused on keeping animals around the world safe, happy and in there natural habitats. PETA was founded on the core belief that you should not mess with nature. They believe animals should have the same rights humans do. Meaning they believe that animals should not be taken out of their Pittard !2 natural habitat. This belief has been seen as controversial because certain animals have the physical capacity to survive in the wild. SeaWorld has taken in multitudes of rescues which would have probably died if left in their natural habitat. It is said that many of these animals need human assistance in order to live a longer and more fulfilling life. This is the case with most rescues, and most organizations support what SeaWorld has to offer these animals, according to Animal Welfare Program. programs and policies are affirmed by numerous federal and state laws, including the Animal Welfare Act, Endangered Species Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act and other statues Perhaps if SeaWorld would agree to put more money into the animals enclosures and healthcare PETA would join that approval list as well. Although PETA has yet to join affirmation list, they have said several negative things to say about animals held in captivity. One of members who used to work as an animal curator in different wrote that and other theme parks which hold animals, people that it is acceptable to interfere with animals and keep them locked up in captivity, where they are bored, cramped, lonely, deprived of all control over their lives, and far from their natural This is a perfect example of how PETA feels toward all types of animal captivity. However, many of claims are made based on the idea that all enclosures are not enough like their natural habitats. It is conceivable that with more funding put the animas SeaWorld could have PETA by their side too. PETA claims that even in the best cases, it is nearly impossible to replicate nature(2) but SeaWorld is already halfway there. On SeaWorlds main website it says that their main goal is to inspire guests to take care of all animals (1). This is just one of the main goals PETA and SeaWorld have in common. Both of these stakeholders care deeply about the health and well being of animals. SeaWorld strives to Pittard !3 not merely entertain their guests, but to care for these animals which they own. Likewise, PETA cares deeply about the well being of all animals. If these two organizations work together, more animals could be safe and healthy. There are some cases, though rare when the captive animals do not have the best life in captivity. For example, Tilikum, the famous orca whale which killed his trainer while in captivity. It is said that Tilikum only killed his trainer because he was taken away from his mother and had been in such a confined space for so long that he simply went mad (4). Tilikum is one of the reasons PETA is so against having animals in captivity. He is a prime example of what can go wrong if not cared for properly. This is why I believe SeaWorld should put more money into the animals enclosures and healthcare. Not only would the larger enclosures draw in more guests due to the more accurate presentations of nature, but it would also make SeaWorld more educational. Accurately demonstrating what goes on in the wild without harming the animals or the watchers. This funding would also benefit PETA as the more endangered species would be safe from poachers. As previously stated, PETA and SeaWorld almost seem to have completely opposite goals. PETA sees SeaWorld as a company which needs money from people wanting to view these animals for entertainment, when in reality SeaWorld is much more than that. PETA wants animals to be left alone in the wild while SeaWorld wants to show the beauty of these exotic creatures to the world. PETA may not realize that main goal is to encourage guests to take care of animals. This goal of SeaWorld could be enough to get PETA to join them in helping show the world it is necessary to protect the animals and to take care of them. PETA is generally against animals being held in captivity at all. However, with this compromise, these two entities Pittard !4 can better protect all animals and the environment around them. After all, both parties consider animals to be friends, not foes. Pittard !5 Works Cited Zoos: Pitiful  PETA. N.p., 2017. Web. 25 Jan. 2017. Entertainment, SeaWorld Parks &.
