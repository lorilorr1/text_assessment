Smoak 1 Conner Smoak Ms. Heiser ENC 1102.069 5 April 2017 The World Outside Our Backyard In the world, there are more than 800 million people who are considered to be food insecure. That is one in every nine people. This number is more than the combined population of the United States, Canada, and the European Union. Poor nutrition in the lives of so many people has traumatic repercussions. 3.1 million Children under the age of five die each year due to poor nutrition, forty five percent of death in children. Over 66 million primary school children go to school hungry across the world. It would take 3.2 billion U.S. dollars a year to fix hunger in students. Many people worry about the future of the world and the hands we are putting the world in, but what if the supposed hands that are going to support the world one day are too weak to hold it due to malnourishment and the fact that they are not being taken care of today. Now you are probably thinking all that stuff is happening in countries that have absolutely nothing and where you do anything about it. While this can be true, this issue hits closer to home than you may realize. In an article published by The Ledger on June 15, 2013, the USDA estimated that there are 50 million people that experience food insecurity in America. Whether you see it or not, people experience food insecurity in every county in America. over 3,000 counties where there are people suffering from food insecurity and over 3,000 counties where there are people who want to do something about their suffering. Smoak 1 In Polk County, the county I grew up in, food insecurity affects 17.3 percent of residents. For Polk children, 27.9 percent are affected by food insecurity. That is more than 39,500 Polk County children dealing with food insecurity. (The Ledger) Not many people understand how many of the people they are surrounded by are affected by this. The worst part is that the people who do know the statistics know what to do to lessen the problem. Here is a program that has made a dramatic impact where from. KidsPack USA is a nonprofit organization dedicated to improve the lives and opportunities of children. (KidsPack) This is made possible by local community volunteers who pack food for children to take home on the weekends. In Polk County, there are more than 3,800 homeless or hungry kids that receive breakfast and lunch during the school week and minimal or nothing for dinner and the weekends. When Kids Pack was started, 449 students in 31 schools in Polk County were being fed on the weekends through this program. In the recent school year, 1,345 students in 66 schools who had this opportunity to have food for the weekends. (KidsPack) My church is one of the many groups of volunteers that are committed to making a difference in these lives by packing these meal backpacks. Now I want to tell you about how helping makes a difference. My mom is a third-grade teacher and has firsthand experience with the effect that these meals have on her students. One Friday this year, she saw one of her former students frantically looking up and down the hallway during dismissal time. She knew he should be out at the bus loading zone so she stopped him and asked him what he was doing and why he getting on the bus. He was looking for the guidance counselor because she dropped off his Kids Pack backpack to his classroom and he planning on going home without it. He was willing to miss the bus home on a Friday afternoon because he had to find his backpack, his food source for the weekend. Smoak 1 She has another little boy this year that receives a backpack of food each weekend too. It has food in it for him and his three-year-old brother. He has some behavior issues, a lot of which stem from the poverty he lives in, and his lack of food. She allows him to be 5th in line when they go to lunch each day because that puts him in the position to be the first one through the lunch line. And even though all of the students get their food within seconds of each other, he is so worried that he is going to miss out on lunch if he the first one to get it. Getting his backpack of food for the weekend is possibly the most important part of his week, at least in his mind. shared the statistics of food insecurity in the world and in America. told you about the effects of hunger on real children and how helping makes a difference. According to a report by RTI International however, there are still many people who are adversely being affected by food insecurity despite the efforts of this country currently. We just sit back and think that someone else will do the job so we need to. Someone else is doing the job but they do it all on their own. We all need to take part to make a difference. Participating in a program such as KidsPack would cause change in not only the lives of those you are helping but also in your own life. If you were on the other side of the problem, you would want anyone who could to help, so why you? The future of the world is in your hands. Smoak 1 Works Cited OUR kidsPACK. (n.d.).
