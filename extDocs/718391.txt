Acevedo 1 Marisela Acevedo Kristen Rouisse ENC 1102 16 April 2017 Stop Factory Farming When people think of animals, they think of animals roaming around free. They think of dogs and cats happily playing in the backyard of a house, a fish or a bird being properly fed on a daily basis. What about the animals that are being served to you on a plate? What happens to these pigs, cows, and chickens? Truth is, majority of the public has no idea of the cruelty animals go through in order to become edible for humans to eat. Factory farming has become a large industry that is more interested in seeing a profit, then putting more emphasis on the way animals are treated at these places. All animals have hearts, organs, eyes, legs, etc. so why are animals on factory farms being tortured for food, while other animals, not residing on these farms, being treated fairly? This must stop; all animals are alive and should not be summoned to a disgrace like this. Thus, because of the mistreatment of animals on factory farms, people with pets should consider transitioning to vegetarian diets. This would allow meat companies to no longer need to produce an excessive number of animals for food and can rightfully care for them. Factory farming is an industrial operation that is dedicated to raising very large numbers of animals to use for food. Currently, more than 99% of farm animals in the United States are raised in factory farms (Farm Animal Welfare). Birds including chickens, turkeys, ducks, and geese are slaughtered 10 times more than any other animal. 8.5 billion chickens are killed for meat and 300 million chickens are used for egg production every year (Animals on Factory Farms). Now imagine, 20,000 chickens raised indoor in a shed, crammed together, living in their Acevedo 2 own waste with high levels of ammonia irritating and burning their eyes and throats (Animals on Factory Farms). Selective breeding forces chickens to grow their breasts quickly, causing them to suffer from heart failure, have trouble breathing, have chronic pain and in many instances, cannot support their own weight. To constantly keep chickens, that are used for meat, eating, the light is always kept on where the chickens are confined. This allows the chickens to constantly eat and rapidly grow while limiting the opportunity for them to sleep and rest. who survive their time in production are often slaughtered at just 42 days old (Farm Chickens used for eggs are the most abused. Female chicks are debeaked using a hot blade to prevent the abnormal feather-pecking from the stress of being confined to battery cages. A beak contains nerves and this process of debeaking is very severe and painful. Male chicks are not useful in this industry and therefore serve no purpose or value. Upon hatching, these male chicks are killed using a grinder while still being alive and conscious (Farm Sanctuary). This is a very unfair treatment considering that chickens are as intelligent and social as mammals like dogs and cats (PETA). Other animals on factory farms are also being abused just like chickens. Pigs and cows are mistreated while confined to small spaces. Meat companies think it is okay to have an excessive number of animals with no proper treatment. Since these poor chickens are being treated inhumane, now image a pet cat or dog being eaten. If this does not sound right, well these practices do exist. Maybe they do not happen here in the United State that humans are aware of but countries such as China, South Korea, and Vietnam allow for this to happen. China hosts an annual Yulin festival where thousands of dogs and cats are killed and eaten. Even though a petition has come to motion to shut this down, it continues. 2.5 million is the number of slaughtered dogs in the South Korea every year (Dore). Acevedo 3 Dogs are said to be a best friend, and it is likely that no person would like to summon their dog to this slaughter process, so chickens be summoned to it either. Chickens can be pets too just like dogs can be. However, the number of animals that are on these factory farms can be reduced. It is certain that all people cannot just suddenly stop eating meat completely. It is understandable that this is a process and can take time. Even if it will take time, switching up to a vegetarian diet is not impossible. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animal (PETA) is an organization that believes animals are not meant for humans eat, wear, experiment on, use for entertainment, or abuse in any other way The founders of this organizations wanted to find a way to change society by promoting a healthy vegan diet. There are many vegan and vegetarian options out there in the world today. Over the years, it has become easier to find meals that allow people to be compassionate to the planet and its inhabitants. To change the world, first, you must change what is on your plate. Maybe people can start from not eating meat at all on a certain day of the week, then from there, it can escalate to not eating meat two days of the week. If people really commit to taking a step like this, it is possible to not only change your lifestyle but that of animals as well. Also, donate to places such as PETA and the American society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) who are dedicated to protecting the rights of animals. Truth is, animals are being treated unfairly in to be served as food. Many people do not realize all the brutal processes animals go through on factory farms. They do not realize farm animals are the least-protected in the animal population in the nation. They are mistreated, abused, forced to grow bigger than their normal size, and slaughtered while they are still alive. Image your pet dog or cat being killed for food. Animals such as pigs, cows, and chickens are Acevedo 4 pets too and deserve better than what they are treated during their lifespan on factory farms. It is up to the public to change their lifestyle and way of eating in order for meat companies to decrease the excessive number of animals they have. With fewer people eating meat, less animal will be needed for food production and with a controlled number of animals, they can be treated properly. It is up to consumers to stop the animal abuse that happens on factory farms. WORD COUNT: (1087) Acevedo 5 Works Cited Animals on Factory  ASPCA. N.p., n.d. Web. 16 Apr. 2017.
