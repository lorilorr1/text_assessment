Mitchell 1 Chase Mitchell Instructor Tisdale ENC 1101 23 February 2017 Is Space Exploration Worth It? Exploring the unknown realm of space has been going on for the past several decades. From discovering new stars and galaxies apart from ours to finding out that Pluto a planet, space exploration has been on the minds of many Americans and people around the world. There has always been talk about whether we should send people into outer space with all the risks involved. Per Jeff Foust, there is accident rate of one every 62.5 missions, through which 14 American astronauts have lost their (4). The conversation on the importance of space exploration has not changed because the benefits and drawbacks have remained constant. The very first talks of traveling in space to see what is out there came after World War II when President Dwight Eisenhower noticed that not only were there military dangers due to the aftermath of the war, but also an arms race. He said rocket fired [for space or signifies a theft from those who hunger and are not Just nine years later in 1962, United States President John F. Kennedy gave his well-known space speech at Rice University where he proclaimed, choose to go to the In the months following speech budget was by 89%...The following year, it went up another (Logsdon 3). In just a nine year difference the most powerful individuals have different views on such a major topic. Mitchell 2 As time goes on, powerful individuals within the space industry have said similar statements as the Stephen Hawking, a famous researcher, discoverer, and author argued that, must colonize other planets to endure long-term (DeGroot 2). Stephen Hawking in the world of astronomy and physics is very well known in his work and studies. His view is like President by continuing to explore and look for other planets that are capable of sustaining life. Rick Hauck, a former astronaut who flew in three space missions in the 80s, gave a lecture at the Wilson Center in Washington D.C. in 2003. He addressed the issue of human space travel and the risks that arises from it. He notes, is impossible to eliminate the risk of human space think I would have flown if I knew the chance of (Carroll 1). Polls throughout history, since the talk of space travel, have generally stayed the same. It has been split 50/50 for and against space exploration. There is also an overall excellent rating of the job that NASA is doing through 1990 through 2006, but it is unlikely that the people who took the poll knew a lot about the space program. One of the polls was me how important you believe the space program is to our It was its lowest in 1994 at forty percent in favor, but in 1995 it skyrocketed due to the release of the movie Apollo 13 up to about fifty-five percent in favor (Whitman 2). As far as the political parties go Democrats are leaning towards the idea of money should be spent on other programs and organizations rather than the space program, while Republicans believe that it is important to use the money on the space program.
