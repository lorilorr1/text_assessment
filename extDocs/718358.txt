Plastic surgery has been used since WWI until now, and it still improving by a new technique that makes the plastic surgery more easy, and helpful. Many people think that cosmetic surgery is improving attractive body part, but indeed there are tow kinds of plastic surgery.

However, the positive effect of cosmetic surgery is more than the negative effect, so that make plastic surgery useful, and make people look more beauty. Harold Gillies was born in 1882, in New Zealand. He studies medicine a Cambridge University in the UK, and he joined the medical corps in France during WWI.

Harold Gillies helped many men slider who lost some parts from their bodies, for example, sustained terrible facial injuries, including the loss of his upper and lower eyelids, while manning the guns aboard the HMS Warspite in 1916 during the Battle of 01). And Surgeon Harold made a smile in his face by used skin graft for the first time, and newly- developed technique was the only way to cure Walter. After that Surgeon Harold Gillies opened a first ward to treat facial deformities at Queen Hospital in London, and that make the field of cosmetic surgery popular. During WWI biggest killer on the battlefield and the cause of many facial injuries was 01). After the battlefield million of men soldiers died, and tow million came severely injured for example some of them they lost some part of their bodies, and the only way to draw the smile in their faces is help them by cosmetic surgery. On another hand, many people do cosmetic surgery to improve their attractive bodies, and the reason that makes people do this kind of surgery is to be a model and look more beauty like Breast Enhancement, Facial Contouring, and Body Contouring.

While some people do plastic surgery to look more beauty, some people have to undergo reconstructive surgery to rebuild their damaged bodies parts after strong bodily injuries because accidents and surgeries mistakes. According to the American Academy of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery spend over $7 million last year in surgical procedures 12), so many people believe that cosmetic surgery can make people in risk for the people who have physical defects. People saying wasting millions for good benefit will make people life better, instead of wasting millions for unneeded cosmetic surgery is not good at all. And only people who had severe injury deserve cosmetic surgery because they need it to live back in their life, for example if someone lost his legs, he will not be able to walk again and that will make him unhappy for the rest of his life. However, reconstructive surgeries help people to continue their life as normal people for example industrial foot or industrial hand for people who lost their hands or foots.
