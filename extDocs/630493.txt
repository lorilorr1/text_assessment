Wang 1 Jialin Wang Kristen Rouisse: ENC 1102 01/29/2017 E-Sport as a Sport E-sport is a form of sport that involves the use of an electronic system to facilitate the primary aspect of the sport, for instance, the player input and the output of the e-sport system arise from the mediation of human-computer interface (Hamari and Sjoblom 2). An example of e-sport is the video gaming. The difference between e-sports and traditional sports is that in the former the competence does not rely primarily on the physical prowess and fitness (Hamari and Sjoblom 3). There is controversy surrounding the e-sport as parties tend to differ on the qualification of the same as a sport. Entertainment and Sports Programming Network (ESPN) is a sports broadcasting network and thus one of the stakeholders in the sports industry (ESPN Media Zone). The International E-Sport Federation (IESF) is, on the other hand, an international body that promotes E-sport and calls for its inclusion in the Olympics (International E-Sports Federation), and the International Olympics Committee has considered the application (Stafford). The aim forms the basis for a disagreement on the issue of including e-sports in the sports category because the former substantially oppose the move. There is no formal attempt for compromise between the two parties, but the consideration of the matter by the International Olympics Committee may form the basis for agreement between the two institutions. The two sides seem not to agree on the definition of sports in regards to the philosophy and sociology of the activity (Seth, Manning, Margaret, & Tracy 5). John Skipper, the head of the ESPN, terms e-sports as competition and not sports (Stafford) while the IESF regards the Wang 2 same as a sport (Stafford). Even though ESPN accepted to have a program for e-sport, it was not after recognizing that the activities deserve the same status as a sport, but it was a result of demands and the urge to maintain business (Stafford). The parties, therefore, seem to disagree on some issues that form the basis for characteristics of sports. According to Seth, Manning, Margaret, & Tracy (Page 5), play is a universal feature of all sports, and this implies voluntary activity with an intrinsic motivation meant for fun and enjoyment. Video games possess the attribute of play as the participants voluntarily play the game for fun and thus fulfilling the characteristic of the play in sports (Seth, Manning, Margaret, & Tracy 5). Also, games appear as a structured play just like sports (Seth, Manning, Margaret, & Tracy 5). However, many people tend to associate games with childhood but when the playful freedom is restricted, structured and codified it qualifies to be a sport (Seth, Manning, Margaret, & Tracy 5). The ESPN and the IESF, therefore, lacks an agreement regarding the play attribute of the e-sports. Seth, Manning, Margaret, & Tracy (Page 6) add that organization is another essential feature of sports as they are goal-oriented activities that conform to rules. In the regular e-sport tournaments, there are teams of people who contest several rounds in a given time, and the games have set standards and regulations for the game and the virtual environment/server setting, and thus the players must follow the rules to succeed in the match. The ESPN, therefore, lacks awareness about this attribute of e-sports and thus causing the disagreement between the party and the IESF. Competition is another aspect of sports, and at the end of the contest there must be a winner/loser (Seth, Manning, Margaret, & Tracy 6), and the formula for winning the game is to identify and execute strategies to outwit the opponent. The goal of winning is a feature of the Wang 3 video games/e-sport, and also, the games involve competition between opponents just like the physical games. The element of having opponents who compete to outdo each other is similar to that of physical competition. ESPN executive refers to e-sports as competition, and thus he fails to acknowledge that competition is just an aspect of e-sport just like in real sports and thus this constitutes the disagreement between the two parties. According to Seth, Manning, Margaret, & Tracy (Page 7), skills is another vital element of sports and chance and luck are not the sole basis for success in a game. The further state that in e-sport, the players execute skillful coordination to manipulate the controller or buttons to direct their respective icon in the match. A party must skillfully manage the virtual participant to outdo the rest just as it happens in real games. ESPN fails to recognize the use of skills in e-sport and thus fails to notice the similarity between it and the real sports. Also, the physicality of gaming is also an essential feature for sports (Seth, Manning, Margaret, & Tracy 9). For instance in soccer, the players must have the physical skills of maneuvering over the defensive opponents towards the goal. In virtual games, the players also engage themselves physically as they have to press or twist buttons to control their icon to maneuver past the opponents, and thus they use tact and physical ability to manipulate the buttons. ESPN does not take into account the physical engagement of e-sport players and hence cannot notice similarity with sports. Even though the ESPN and IESF do not seem to agree on the inclusion of e-sport in sports, to some extent, they have a universal agreement regarding the issue of sports. According to Stafford, Skipper the head of ESPN refers to e-sport as competition, and this shows the appreciation of e-sport. However, the ESPN only fails to equate the competition in e-sport to that Wang 4 one in real sports. IESF, on the other hand, does not dispute that e-sport is a competition but only feels that it is more than just a competition. The aim of ESPN is to have e-sport excluded in sports while IESF wishes to have e-sport included in the sports category (Stafford). Since the former opposes the move basing on the physical attribute of the sports, a good solution to the problem could be exploring the definition of sports, and examining the flexibility of Olympics in the contemporary world to inform the two parties. According to Stafford, the definition of Olympics lost rigidity when other sports like shooting and archery that did not have an athletic nature were included in the Olympics. Also, it is worth explaining to the two parties that physical element is not the only attribute of sports and bearing in mind that e-sport has all the other attributes (Seth, Manning, Margaret, & Tracy 5-9) it does qualify as a sport. The solution to the problem is, therefore, explaining to the ESPN about all the aspects of sports. The real definition of sports as stated by Seth, Manning, Margaret, & Tracy (Pages 5-9) is that it entails the playfulness, skills, physical engagement, competition, and organization. Since the e-sport has these attributes, nothing can change the facts, and thus the ESPN has no option but to understand that. Also, since Olympics accommodate games that have less athletic attributes (Stafford), the ESPN should acknowledge the dynamics of the Olympics. Also, technology is changing and so are the minds so the ESPN must move with the technology. E-sports are virtual games whereby participants pick icons in a computer interface as representatives. The ESPN and IESF tend to disagree on the issue as the former insists that e- sport is not a sport while the latter insists that it is. The reasons why the two do not agree on the issue is that ESPN does not understand the attributes of sports and these are playfulness, skills, Wang 5 physical engagement, competition, and organization. A common ground between the two stakeholders is that they both acknowledge the element of competition in sports. The solution to the problem is making the ESPN understand the meaning of sports and all its attributes. The feasibility of the above idea is that reality does not change, and hence ESPN has no option but to accept the facts. Wang 6 Work Cited About ESPN.
