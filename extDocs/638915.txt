VanWingerden 1 Jonah VanWingerden Mr. Josue ENC 1102 29 January 2017 The Impact of Heightened Government Surveillance Today Americans live in a society that immediately welcomes advances in technology, so much so that it could start to be threatening to the rights. As smartphones increased in popularity, the technology included in them began to be more advanced. These devices went from having a simple camera for taking pictures to now including multiple high definition cameras, multiple microphones and even fingerprint scanners. Initially, these technological advances may seem like nifty features to have on a mobile device but what about the people that want to take advantage of this technology? There have been a few instances where the government has used advanced technology as a form of surveillance and there are many organizations who disagree with this. The American Civil Liberties Union and the Global Government Surveillance Reform are just two of the organizations with distinct opinions concerning this situation, although they may disagree on what should be done, they both can agree that something needs to change. The ACLU is an organization who believes in protecting civil liberties and will fight hard for what they believe is right for the people the para 2). Because of this, they are fighting for the elimination of government surveillance altogether. They demand that since the government is not telling them when they conducting this surveillance and what their using it for, it is against the constitution because they are not being transparent. They have even stated has shown that powerful, secret surveillance tools will almost certainly be VanWingerden 2 abused for political ends and turned disproportionately on disfavored Implying that this has happened in the past and it has not gone well and para 3). They want this idea of government surveillance to go away completely because they feel its infringing on their right to privacy. On the other hand, the GGSR believes the idea of surveillance is okay, but would like to know more about what the government is doing with this information. The Global Government Surveillance Reform is a group supported by influential employees from companies such as: Apple, Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook, and Google. Since these companies that host services and produce devices that are capable of collecting information that the government would be interested in, their opinion on the matter is very important. They establish principles that define exactly what they believe in, touching on transparency, government conflict and government authority Government para 3). Because the included companies play such a huge part in the collection of information, the GGSR is not against the idea of government surveillance although they believe that the current approach of is pushing it too far Open Letter to para 2). Although the ACLU and the GGSR have opposing opinions on what should be done about government surveillance, they both can agree that something needs to be done. The current method of the government just doing whatever they want frustrates both organizations. The ideal solution would be to completely remove the possibility of the government being able to collect personal information or tap into cameras or phones when they are in need of it. The ideal solution is more along the lines of having set standards or guidelines that would be followed when the government is in need of this information. They would also like to VanWingerden 3 be notified when the government is in need of this personal information and what they are using it for. For both the ACLU and the GGSR to agree on a solution it needs to benefit both organizations. If there were to be a branch of the government specifically dedicated to surveillance that could oversee all surveillance, it could allow standards to be set. This branch could work with the GGSR and ACLU to make core principles to follow when assessing this surveillance. Although there would be surveillance which does not coincide with the ideal solution, it would be completely controlled and only done when it is specifically needed such as threats of terrorism. As for the GGSR, this would more suit their ideal solution mainly because it is less demanding. But they would still have to pertain to guidelines set up in part by the ACLU. Some of these surveillance guidelines would be to limit the way information is collected to volunteered information such as publicly shared photos, posts and locations. Another guideline would be to have an option people can opt in to on their devices to allow government surveillance to be done at any time on this device. This gives the people the option to not be included in surveillance on an individual level while still allowing for surveillance to be conducted. The new surveillance branch would also need to be responsible for notifying organizations of the surveillance. So, for instance, if they want to know what is the number one Google search in the state of Texas, they would have to let Google know they are doing this and explain to them what they are using the information for. Google could then display a message to the people in Texas that their searches are being used for a government investigation. In conclusion, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Global Government Surveillance Reform may have different ideas of how the government should perform surveillance. But with the creation of a surveillance branch that takes care of both the people and VanWingerden 4 the companies involved by protecting their information but also protecting them.
