Khawaja ENC1101.903S17 30 April 2017 The Effect of Video Games on Children The past few decades showed the strong shift in the importance of technology in the lives of people. Electronic devices are now used in almost every aspect of life, whether it is communication or household duties. The audience of technology users is expanding and now includes children, who play video games on their devices starting from a very young age. This shift in preferences is a concern to some parents who believe that devices are replacing real life communication and outdoor activities. Other parents worry that video games are addictive, cause violence, and have a negative effect on the physical development of the kids. However, discussion of video games often ignores the fact that video games are able to provide benefits that cannot be found anywhere else. Despite all the concerns caused by video games use, there is a strong evidence suggesting that they are capable of positively affecting physical and mental development of a person. The debate as to whether video games are good or bad for children has been going for over two decades. Fortunately, there are a number of studies that confirm the positive impact of video games on various aspects of life. Video games are packed with actions and require player to make decisions quickly, which correlates with the fast paced environment of the modern life. Unsurprisingly, playing action games for a long time improves a wide range of mental processes. Some of these improvements include visual acuity, cognitive control and generalized improvements in perceptual learning (Berard, Cain, Watanabe 1). Additional evidence confirm Samsonenko 2 that people who played action video games often were proficient in multiple distractors, quickly identifying visual targets, stretching visual attention over a wide eccentricity range, and resisting the (Green, Bavelier 2). Action games obviously affect mental processes, but there are also numerous other games aimed at increasing other abilities in children. Educational games are often overlooked in the video game debate due to their lack of violence. However, it was proven by Prot, Mcdonald, Anderson, and Gentile that spatial skills and specific knowledge are improved by these games. Additionally, long exposure to educational games showed to improve creativity in kids in tasks such as drawing pictures and writing stories (Henion, Jackson). On the contrary, such effect was not caused by other activities such as use of cell phones, the Internet and computers. Thus, video games can contribute to the mental development in a more efficient way than other forms of technology. Contrary to the popular belief video games are also capable of creating some positive health-related benefits. Apparently, video games could improve eyesight by the brain to spot small details, follow movements and spot subtle light (Collins). Other evidence show that children with dyslexia are able to improve their reading abilities after only 12 hours of playing video games that do not involve any special phonological training (Franceschini, Sandro, et. al 4). Improved attention, reading skills and eyesight are only some of the health benefits of playing various genres of videogames that are not specifically meant to improve these issues. Yet, all the listed benefits are often ignored in favor of the argument that video games cause more mental and physical problems than benefits. One of the issues that is often highlighted by opponents is that video games supposedly encourage violence and aggression. Another point is made that normally, gameplay does not provide option of a non-violent conflict Samsonenko 3 resolution. Indeed, violence in video games has been linked to the aggression in young adults. However, American Psychological Association claims that there is evidence to link violent video play to criminal According to the study by Jenkins, the rate of juvenile violent crime in the United States is at a 30-year low. Additionally, people committing crimes tend to be exposed to media less than those people who do not commit crime. Therefore, there are various social factors impacting the violence, but video games are highly unlikely to cause a severe impact on children. Teenagers are able to leave the emotional effects of the game behind when they stop playing and live their regular life. In addition, opponents of video games often make a point that video gaming makes children more isolated and leaves them less time to play sports and do other outdoors activities. This is a valid concern because, according to CDC, obesity rate among children ages 2-19 is currently at 17%. Taylor, Jenson, Castell and Dilouya make a counter argument by claiming that games serve as an addition to a life, not as it substitute. Often times games are played with a group of friends and being by him/herself is not common among gamers. Additionally, gaming companies realized that this issue exists and introduced Wii Fit to the market. This console features games such as yoga, strength training, aerobics, and balance (Wii Fit). It has been used widely in physiotherapy, which proves that video games develop in response to the requests from the audience. Currently, 90% of American children and teens play video games (Prot et. Al.). Constantly growing use of gadget is certainly causing concern among parents, video game companies and the government. There is no denying that kids who spend too much time playing video games may exhibit impulsive behavior and have attention problems. However, it has been proven that video games are capable of improving cognitive skills, spatial skills, creativity and Samsonenko 4 specific knowledge. But not only there are mental benefits, but physical too. Video games are capable to help people with coordination issues, bad eye sight and dyslexia, among many others. Stakeholders of the issue need to pay attention and limit the amount of time spent playing videogames and control if the mix of educational activities is appropriate for the age. This approach will ensure that children receive the best possible effects from playing video games. After all, there are many concerns about the impact of video games, but there is also a lot of proof of their positive effect. Samsonenko 5 Works Cited Berard, Aaron V., et al.
