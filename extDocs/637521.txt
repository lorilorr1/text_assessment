1 Jorge Prof. M. Heiser ENC 1102.069 1 st February 2017 Should animals be used for commercial testing The topic of animal testing for commercial use has been a controversial issue in the United States for a long time. Not all products require animal testing, many of them even need animals to ensure the safety of the product in human use, but still there are companies that test their products for commercial use on animals. There are many organizations in the United States of America that debate on whether it is good or bad to test on animals for commercial purposes. There are organizations that practice pro-animal testing like: the Research Defense Society, the Royal Society and the Foundation for Biomedical Research. These organizations (stakeholders) aim to keep continuing animal testing so they test their products on humans. Other organizations like: Coalition for Consumer Information on Cosmetics (CCIC), and PETA (People for Ethical Treatment of Animals) aim to eliminate animal testing for commercial use by creating laws in favor of animals and against animal cruelty. Even though these stakeholders have different points of view, they both share a compromise to eliminate animal testing for commercial use by using better alternatives. PETA the biggest organization for animal protection and rights in the world focuses on the elimination of animal testing for commercial use, this slogan: are not ours 2 to eat, wear, experiment on, use for entertainment, or abuse in any other (PETA organization) attempts to achieve animal rights. These animals that get tested are forced to inhale and ingest toxic substances that make them suffer before their deaths. At the end, these animals are either killed, dissected or thrown away, because of these reasons the director of the U.S. National Institute of Health Dr. Elias Zerhouni stated during a government meeting: problem is that animal testing worked, and time we stopped dancing around the problem. We need to refocus and adapt new methodologies for use in humans to understand disease biology in So, to end the suffering of animals for commercial use, the organization aims to use a less expensive and non-animal testing alternatives like: the Vitro testing (Harvard Wyss Institute), computer modeling and research with human volunteers. The Vitro testing consists of a chip that imitates the organs and tissues of humans that can be used when testing chemicals, drugs and cosmetics. It is a more effective and accurate representation of testing that does not need the use of animals. The computer modeling research is a computer based technique that simulates how the drugs will react with the human body by using applications. Lastly, the human volunteers research focuses on injecting micro doses of the substance to the human volunteer, not causing any harm with accurate test results. These methods are not the only ways that PETA has contributed to the animal world. PETA has also worked on campaigns which have reduced animal testing and has spared thousands of animal lives and it has enlightened the people by providing eye-opening information on their websites. The Research Defense Society is an organization that promotes the use of testing on animals for commercial use. The organization believes in the use of animal testing to find cures and resolutions for diseases, they also believe that not all artificial testing is accurate for human 3 use. Like for example: the organization thinks that the Vitro testing research is 100% accuerate because it is a machine that bases its results with artificial objects. That is why scientists from this organization provide many points on why animals should be tested: rats possess a 95% similarity of genes with humans making it a perfect model for testing products, modern products still rely on animal testing for complete and accurate results (Understanding Animal Research), thanks to animal research cancer survival rates have increased significantly, animal suffer from same diseases as us like TB, flu, asthma, etc. and lastly these scientists do not want to risk humans live by exposing them to chemicals and other toxic objects. Can a compromise be achieved? The answer is yes! As the Chief Executive of the BIA, Aisling Burnand stated: this stage, the view of research represents a balanced proposal that considers both animal welfare and research The statement made Aisling proposes a compromise from both sides that benefits both stakeholders by saving the animals from commercial testing and using new research alternatives that can cost less money. So, even though PETA concentrates on protecting animal rights and the Royal Research Society encourages animal testing for commercial products, both of these stakeholders believe in the usage of alternative testing for commercial use not involving animal use. Both of these stakeholders want to end animal suffering from commercial testing, since they think it is inhumane. Even though one stakeholder encourages the use of animal testing for commercial purposes and the other defends animal rights, they can both reach a compromise and benefit from it. Both stakeholders can benefit from a compromise because: new alternatives costs less money (using animals costs a lot of money because buying them, using different objects every time they test 2 them and using different resources costs too much money, but by using artificial methods, it costs less money since it is safer the researches and it requires less materials for the research) , laws can be ignored since animals are not suffering from testing (there were various laws and campaigns against animal testing because of the suffering these animals endure), and animals do not die or suffer from testing. With the unity of both organizations, animal suffering can end and new methods not involving the use of animals can be created, ending a controversial issue that has been present for years in the United States.
