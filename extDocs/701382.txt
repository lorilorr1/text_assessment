Stagg 1 Brooke Stagg Drugan ENC 1102. 071 24 February 2017 Analyzing Visual Rhetoric Trophy Free EU Group is an organization that aspires to bring awareness to the world about the adverse effects that trophy hunting can have on the already fragile ecosystem that is in place in countries that fall prey to trophy hunting. This organization was founded in 2014 and originated in Finland. It is the joint project of three conservationist organizations (Trophy Free EU Group). This organization brings awareness by hosting several campaigns that aim to educate the public on how dangerous trophy hunting can be to the ecosystem and to the animals themselves. On their website, the organization has several advertisements that address how the act of trophy hunting is not a sport but is a dangerous pastime that will affect everyone in time. One of their main goals aside from education is to disprove the belief that trophy hunting is a form of conservation. The organization does this by showing photographs on their webpage that highlights the harsh reality of trophy hunting. The two images selected below illustrate the belief that trophy hunting does not help in conservation efforts using the rhetorical appeals of pathos and ethos. The first of several images on this groups website that highlights the harsh reality of the effects of trophy hunting features a lion that is trapped behind several fences in a large enclosure. There are fences that separate two groups of lions from each other. This image shows how trapped the lions are in order to make it easier for the tourists to have a kill. Some advocates of trophy hunting believe that this is a more favorable alternative to trophy hunting of Stagg 2 animals in the wild. The second of the images that helps illustrate this point of view is an infographic that features a close up view of the face of a lion in captivity and features a statistic about the number of lions that are being born, raised, and slaughtered in contained trophy hunting scenarios every day. Both images use pathos and ethos to appeal to the viewer and makes them want to work with this group to put an end to the so-called sport of trophy hunting. The first image appeals to pathos by making the viewer feel negative emotions because it clearly represents the desire of the lion to be free. The viewer of this photograph can tell the animal would like to be let loose from this enclosure because it is at the barrier of the enclosure. This implies that the lion has explored all that there is to explore inside of his contained area, and would like to see the rest of the world. The containment of these majestic animals is so against their nature that it makes the animals restless and uncomfortable to be held in captivity. This photograph forces the viewer to feel the anxiety that these animals must feel because of the composition of the photograph. The photograph also appeals to pathos by making the viewer feel the loneliness that these animals feel while they are in captivity. It is unnatural for a lion to live with only one other animal. It is necessary for lions to receive the socialization that comes with the existence of a pride of lions. In the image, it is plain to see that the fence is dividing two groups of loins into smaller groups. This is done to facilitate easier hunts for the tourists that occupy the establishment where this photograph was taken. These animals are forced to get their natural amounts of socialization through a chain-link fence. This image plays on several emotions of the viewer in hopes that the viewer of this image would work with the organization to help put an end to the practice of trophy hunting. Stagg 3 The second image also uses pathos to appeal to the viewer by forcing them to feel the depression and loneliness the lion feels. Even though there is only one of the eyes visible, the expression that is on this face is clearly a sad one. The way the photo is zoomed in on part of the face creates an emotional effect on the viewer by forcing the viewer to look into the lifeless eyes. This angle pushes the viewer to realize how poorly the lions living conditions are. The lion appears to look depressed because it has found itself enclosed in a confined space and all it can do is peer out the slit of the cage. This advertisement can be found on a website called Cannedlion.org which aims to expose the reality of trophy hunting and more specifically, canned hunting using various pathos strategies. a world without the lion. No mighty roars or glorious manes. A world without the most glorious and majestic animal on (Edward Bourke 1). Bourke is a young member of the canned lion organization and spends his volunteer hours educating the public about the changes that need to be made. He shares the same standpoint that Trophy Free EU Group does regarding the dangers of trophy hunting. He believes that it is impossible for trophy hunting to exist as a continuation of hunting efforts, just like Trophy Free EU Group does. Ethos is a rhetorical appeal centered around morals and credibility. Both images selected have a moderate amount of ethos portrayed in them. The first image appeals to ethos because of the chain link fence running down the middle of the photo. The fence expresses how the pride of lions are forced to be separated for hunting purposes which are clearly immoral and cruel to the wild animals. The inclusion of the dividing fence down these two separate groups of lions forces the viewer to consider the morality of the practice. It makes the viewer think about how they would feel if their family were split into two groups and not allowed to have the socialization and interaction that they need. Stagg 4 The second image appeals to ethos by including the logo of a popular news outlet on the photograph. This lets the viewer know that the information is coming from a credible source. The inclusion of this logo was not done accidentally, for it was included to make the image and the Trophy Free EU Group seem more credible. If the problem is being reported on by a major news network, then it must be a real problem. This is the thought process that the common viewer of this image had. Major news outlets like MSNBC would not waste their time reporting on things that are not considered real issues. The second image is an ad run by MSNBC that promoted the premiere of a documentary entitled Blood Lions which aired October 7 th of 2015 (Freidman 2015). The Trophy Free EU Group is located out of Sweden. It collaborates both globally and nationally to educate people on the dangers and impracticality of canned hunting in African countries. It is clear their beliefs are founded in scientific merit as well as care and compassion for the animals that are forced to fight against the practice of trophy hunting and canned hunting. This is a belief that is shared amongst many different influential groups throughout the globe, and hopefully this belief will help put an end to trophy hunting and canned hunting.
