This form of violence occurs more often than some may assume, which is why it is so important to educate individuals on this crime. The Joyful Heart Foundation was created by Mariska Hargitay in 2004 After starring on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, playing a role of a domestic violence victim, Hargitay gained an interest for helping those who have experienced domestic violence Individuals began to send Hargitay their personal stories in hopes of being supported and healed from their emotional trauma they have experienced.

Figure 1 and 2, worked together to advocate for victims of these related crimes in hopes of ending this form of violence. In Figure 1 produced by the Joyful Heart Foundation, it incorporates a common response of those who have known someone that has experienced violence or abuse.

While this is very common in our community, it is still important for individuals to become aware of the social aspects concerning sexual violence. Meaning, the emotional trauma a victim endures after experiences that form of abuse must be understood by others. The Joyful Heart Foundation utilizes the element ethos to establish credibility for this campaign ad. The famous actress Debra Messing, appears on the ad to insure the audience that if this actress agreed to be featured on the campaign ad, that this advertisement must be credible. It is important to establish this credibility, because the audience becomes more inclined to trust what is being presented in the advertisement. In addition to Debra Messing being featured in the image, the foundation has included their well-known logo to provide more credibility for the viewers. The pathos presented in Figure 1, is represented through the facial expression of the woman featured in the advertisement. The woman appears to have a stern-look, this expression provokes the audience to obey what is being said in the campaign advertisement. Daniels 3 The feeling the audience gains is a feeling of guilt and remorse from the individuals who may have reacted negatively towards victims of violence and abuse. There is an appeal to logos when it states on the advertisement, more excuses, no more silence, no more For the audience, this appeal to logos forces individuals to reflect upon their own personal influence on the continuation of violence and abuse and what they could do differently to help towards the ending of this violence.

This is showing the audience that victims of violence and abuse, are not always able to vocalize what they are involved in. Therefore, it is up to subjects that are surrounded by the victim to be able to know the common signs of sexual assault, child abuse, and domestic violence.

This meaning that the subject has undergone a tremendous amount of abuse and has become use to the treatment that has been given. This appeal to pathos, immediately provokes the audience to sympathize with the victim and the viewer becomes intrigued by the advertisement. In addition to the facial expression, there is a finger over the mouth. This is expressing that the female must remain silent and Daniels 4 not seek help from others. The audience again feels sympathy towards the victim. In figure 2, in the campaign ad it states, In return viewers who are victims of violence or abuse, will feel inclined to reach out to a support group and share their personal experiences.

The stakeholder, decided to have the words, written in a large font to convey the strong message of individuals in the community to not pass on judgement towards victims of this crime. Figure 2 takes a different approach, by using a black background to focus the attention on the woman who appears to be a victim of either sexual assault, or domestic violence. The woman is displayed in washed out tones versus vibrant, further illustrating that the victim is in an overwhelming state. In Figure 1 and 2, the stakeholder has a woman featured in the advertisement. In doing so, both figures work to reach out to women in our society versus men. Choosing to bring in an audience of women, supports the statistic, of the victims of rape and sexual assault are female, and 9% are Victims of Sexual Violence: Statistics ).
