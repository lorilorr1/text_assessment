Al-Suleimani 1 Basel Al-Suleimani Cat Modlin-Jackson ENC 1101 1/29/2017 Climate Change and Extinction Climate change is a global issue that endangers our lives nowadays. Researchers over the years have tried to discover the real causes of climate change. They tried to define the animals that extinct due to climate change so that they can define the actual causes of climate change. Polar bears and melomys are considered the first modern endangered animals that might become extinct because of climate change but which one was really the first modern endangered animal? That is what researchers were trying to discover. Researchers state that natural disasters are the fundamental cause of climate change before the year 2010, but after that year, Scientists and researchers have started blaming activities and consider them as the essential cause of climate change after the consequences of the industrial revolution. Throughout the years, scientist have found out the first animal that became endangered due to climate change. Before 2010, researchers have discovered that the first modern animal that become endangered because of the climate change is polar bears. According to Bravo, In Predictors Of Late Quaternary bears are the first modern animals that are endangered because of climate change, their habitat is melting. They swim in the open ocean searching for ice. the for the effects of climate change on 2442). Polar bears became endangered and a lot of them already became extinct because of the rising of temperature which melts the ice. After 2010, researchers found that there is another animal which considered the first animal who became endangered Al-Suleimani 2 because of the climate change and exactly the rising seas. In Climate Change Causes Beckrich said in 2016, first modern mammal driven extinct by climate change the polar bear but a small Australian rodent called the Bramble Cay melomys (1). The Bramble Cay melomys became endangered before the polar bear as the late source explains. Another difference between the time period before 2010 and after 2010 is the real causes of global warming. Global warming nowadays is considered as the main factor of climate change and people have to define the causes of global warming to find the solutions. Global warming has so many causes that are divided to two essential causes, which are human causes and natural causes. Before 2010, the studies indicate that natural disasters are the main cause of global warming. In Extinction Risk from Climate Urban states that rotation around the earth, the volcano, flood and heat waves are the main causes of global warming. (571). The natural disasters like volcano are the standard causes of the global warming as the earlier source states. However, after 2010, scientists declared that human activities are the main cause of global warming nowadays. In Change, Elevational Range Shifts, and Bird Sekercioglu said in 2015, the chemical fertilizers, deforestation, industrial and pollution are the main causes of global warming (147). According to Sekercioglu, burning fossil fuels and destroying forests, humans trap (148). Humans are committing crimes toward the earth by their activities such as, using fossil fuels and deforestation. Human activities increase some gases on the air which can be so harmful if its proportion found on a big amount. Climate change became a world-wide issue that harms our planet and it can kill so many creatures. Industrial revolution made our air polluted and even our water by the smoke as the smoke causes high temperatures on earth. Also, deforestation and burning fossil fuels increased Al-Suleimani 3 the heat of our planet. Natural disasters can cause climate change, but Human skills nowadays considered the main cause of climate change. People know that the industrial revolution causes many issues for earth and some scientists started to do researchers to find solutions. Researchers discovered that the Bramble Cay melomys is the first endangered animal because of climate change. Al-Suleimani 4 Works Cited: David, et al.
