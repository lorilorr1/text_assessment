The food habit the atmosphere all effect our health so people should maintain their lifestyle to stay fit and healthy. Being healthy helps to stay active and improves our mental and physical health.

Cleveland Clinic is a very reputed hospital and has been established in 1921. It has been owned by Cleveland Clinic Foundation which is a non-profit organization and its located in Cleveland Ohio. It has been doing very well in this short period and has been known very good for cardiac surgery. Cleveland Clinic releases images to show their position as one of the leading hospitals. Using the rhetorical appeals ethos, logos and Kairos the two images represents Cleveland goals effectively. Cleveland Clinic has hit the world with its brilliant all-round performance in most of the departments. It has a lot of well-known and specialized doctors at each department who are maintain a good synchronization with each other to keep the Cleveland Clinic reputation to the peak. Cleveland Clinic also has advanced which also makes their services more better and somewhat cost effective.

Cleveland Clinics mission statement is care of the sick, investigation into their problems and further education of those who This means they are customer orientated and they also provide higher education and make more talented doctors.

It may result for the logo which denotes the brand or even by using a celebrity in the advertisement can act as ethos. Here in the advertisement image of Cleveland Clinic the ethos is the logo which is the picture. It describes credibility of Cleveland Clinic and it helps to identify the brand and the goodwill of Cleveland Clinic. means logic and it denotes clarity of the argument with proper evidence and reasons. It helps to identify the main reason of why Cleveland Clinic set the advertisement for and it helps the consumers to understand the main jest of the image. Here in the image Cleveland Clinic mentioned life deserves world class Even the Yasreeb 3 statistics as mentioned here means logos. As a result, they are showing that from 2010 to 2011 they have been improved a lot in terms of technology and advanced a lot to give patients the best care available. means timeliness it also means to identify the right time to obtain a desirable result. It can also be a comparison of time to show improvements examples can be Here in this image the Kairos is the comparisons between time from 2010 Cleveland Clinic did one lung transplant in 3 days which is the quickest comparatively and in 2011 they have improved so much now that they can regrow bone. This timely comparison is Kairos in here. Also, kairos can be in another way such that Cleveland Clinic can do lung transplant the fastest and at the same time they can regrow bone now so the people who have such problem can act as soon as possible and go to Cleveland Clinic for treatment. This also shows timeliness. On the other hand, image 2 there are also the rhetorical appeals ethos, logos, kairos and these are discussed down as follows: Ethos means credibility as I mentioned above and the credibility in the image 2 by Cleveland Clinic is again in their logo which defines their brand and the important meaning which is their four foundation and it also defines that it was founded by four owners. So the logo is the ethos in this picture. Whereas the logos which means logic here the logic is that Cleveland Clinic wants to say people that they take people as their centre of attraction this means they care for people and their happiness. That is why they are opening new branch in Canada so that people can avail their services more easily and their goodwill and brand name improves more. Yasreeb 4 At last, the Kairos means timeliness and here kairos is that Cleveland Clinic opened new branch in Canada so they want people to come quickly to Cleveland Clinic to provide them with the best service and make them realize that they are their centre of attraction. These appeals which were used in the advertisements worked very well because their advertisements were very simple and clear as the first image they showed statistics and very clearly the ethos was mentioned in it because of the logo and the other appeals fitted perfectly except pathos though. Logic is the statistic and Kairos is the improvement within that time. By showing statistics and showing new improvements by Cleveland Clinic such as the fastest leading lung transplant and even regrowth bones will attract more people and make them trust more on Cleveland Clinic. On the other hand, it also goes perfectly with their mission statement as they are improving more to treat patients with the best care. The other image by Cleveland Clinic also met their goals and was successful to be caught in the eyes of the people. Ethos is the logo of Cleveland Clinic, no pathos in it again, logos is that they care for people and they opened new branch for convenience and kairos is that Cleveland Clinic wants people to come quick to their new branch in Canada. This is because their advertisement message was completely customer orientated and people will be attracted by their way of approach and their care towards their patients. Yasreeb 5 In the end, the approaches and the way Cleveland Clinic is advertising their brand shows their excellent service and shows why they one of the leading hospitals. They also advanced in technologies and gathering the best doctors from all over the world. They also provide internships and gives on the job experience for young promising future doctors. As they are one of the best hospitals they are a respectable brand for the patient and a reliable one too. Thus, the two images used by Cleveland Clinic met the ethos, logos and Kairos perfectly and this appeals were all successful enough to attract the consumers or the patients because the advertisements were all simple and easy to understand. Thus, Cleveland Clinic is right now one of the most reputed and leading hospitals in the world. 1244 words Yasreeb 6 Work Cited 1.Cleveland Clinic, Founders Date Accessed- 26 th February 2017.http://my.clevelandclinic.org/about/overview/who-we-are/mission-vision-values 2.Cleveland Clinic, Date Accessed-26 th February 2017. 4. https://image.slidesharecdn.com/clevelandclinicadcampaign-111014091024- phpapp02/95/cleveland-clinic-ad-campaign-5-728.jpg?cb=1318583487
