Nguyen 1 Thuan Hoang Nguyen Kristin Gocinski ENC1102.909 21 April 2017 Stand Against Hatred The world has never been quiet, due to all kind of hates that keep growing. This world is filled with discrimination, stereotyping, and hate, where everyone is being conditioned to hate and is showing a lack of tolerance towards each other. In the modern world, hatred is spreading rapidly due to the updates from media, which keeps shifting the information to change belief. Moreover, the cognition of mankind is gullible so people easily fall into the trap of media. Hatred is a natural feeling that is generated within the evolution of humans. Basically, hatred is evolved with the environment that people are living in. Nowadays, what most people have to deal with when they reach out to the world is social psychology, which simply is behavior that associate with prejudice, intergroup hostility and aggressive behavior (Harrington 1). In the world of hate, everyone should increase understanding in collaboration and communication, which every individuals can do by coming together and preaching about the love. Moreover, what everyone can do is to donate to charities that provide education to the less fortunate areas, so that they can put an end to hate crimes across the globe. Since the world is a multicultural place, so individuals or groups look at the world differently. Basically, the problem of hate can be generated by the differences in the perspective of different groups. According to Jacobs, the author of The Journal of Hate Studies, he mentioned that there is a set of behaviors within any religious community, as Nguyen 2 this is also true to any race (Jacobs 225). Moreover, to be characterized as moral or ethical, the members must follow that set of behaviors, which consists the series of guidelines. The research also showed that there is a mix of positive and negative behaviors when it came across the members in a group and the outsiders. Basically, when a belief system is challenged, the fight or flight response is triggered to overcome the challenges. Furthermore, hate is generated when a group of powerful people is directing a group of non-power people. Dr. Phillip Zimbardo conducted an experiment, which was the It was used to show that appearance affects on perception, and also people with differences would stand up against each other to defend their opinions. Admittedly, there are authorities to keep the world in peace, but hatred comes from the differences in the perspective of human about the world. Thus, the problem of hate can be defined as the disagreement between different individuals, where one has different perspective to another. Nowadays, people already acted to show that they hated each other. Generally, the actions of hate are usually negative and the outcomes are ugly. From verbally to physically, mankind has shown that they cannot stand with each other. Human hate each other on many levels and the attacks or terrorists showed it. Basically, every group have a specific system that is used to speak up for them and not every group has the same belief system, so that the groups start to show intergroup hostility and aggressive behavior towards each other. One suggested solution to this is that, according to Ros Wynne, author of the article Hope Over Hate, she stated, we think about how to respond to the Paris killings, we should look at how the people behind the attacks want us to respond. And do the (Wynne par.6). People should think about how the Nguyen 3 terrorists want them to respond and do different to that thinking, so that terrorists fail to achieve their goal. Furthermore, hate is still there since extremists keep planning big attacks not to show the disagreement, but to spread fear among the world (Starling par.2). The extremists are people who want to world peace so they keep bringing fear, anguish, and hate to the whole world. Spreading fear by using hate actions, extremists do not want the world to stay in peace. Maya Angelou once said that has caused a lot of problems in the world, but it has not solved one so applying hate onto hate seems like a bad idea, since it will provoke for more hate, and might become and endless war of hate. Instead of fighting back with hate, people can stop the hate with more peaceful action. Instead of curing hate, people should think about preventing hate. By educating the young generations about peace and love, so that the world will become a better place. In this world of hate, what people should do is to increasing communication between mankind, which is to raise awareness of the society, by uniting them and preaching about this sort of behavior (Webster par.1). Since children are the young generation, who easily absorb and imitate the surrounding environment into their meaning systems, so every individual can get involved by creating nonjudgmental environment for their children. This can easily be done in the place where the environment where adults are committed in changing the world a better place, where people can start to build and develop nonjudgmental environments for their children. However, there are still kids that being raised in the environment that contains full of violence, abuse, and stress. As Emily Burr mention in her article, Why Do We Hate?, children from these environments may become adults who underreact to threats, Nguyen 4 including societal punishments. These are the children who can become violent sociopaths with no empathy for their victims and no fear of any (Burr 1). In other words, these kids are more likely to develop to perceived threats with violence, fear, and hatred. Yet, donating to charities that provide education to these areas can solve this. Every small action will make a big change for the world, where love triumphs over hate. In conclusion, hate is a global problem, which causes many troubles to the world and not solving anything. In order to prevent hate problems, every individual should come together and accept each other despite differences. Moreover, everyone can help by educating the young generations about peace and love; also donate to charities that provide education to those miserable areas. After all, hate is a problem that cannot be pushed away, but it can be faded from the society, where everyone unite, collaborate, and communicate with each other. Hate can never be ceased to exist, but hate problems can be overcome by the power of unity, peace, and love. Nguyen 5 Works Cited Burr, Emily.
