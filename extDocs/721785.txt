An uncle enjoying the festivities at his graduation party. A depressed teenager who has just attempted suicide. Aside from being human, all three of these people share common characteristics and needs. Though some may not consider it to be important, one of the most basic needs of any human being that a part of the elite rich society of our world is medical insurance. Though some may argue that medical insurance should only be provided for physical health issues, medical insurance should be readily available for mental and physical health problems considering that ACA defined coverage of mental health and substance use treatment as one of the ten essential health (Health Policy Brief). Anyone that has no experience with mental health issues should consider their loved ones and how mental parity has helped them. First and foremost, I will describe what mental parity is. For those who do not know, mental parity is a set of laws and regulations that state that health insures plans must offer the same amount of coverage for mental health when compared to the amount of coverage for physical health. According to the Health Policy Brief on HealthAffairs.org, the first of these laws came out in 1996, and it was known as the Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA). This act prohibited health insurance plans that already included mental health from charging higher annual or lifetime dollar amounts for their coverage. It is important to note that this act did not require plans to include mental health care, it merely placed limits on the amount paid for mental health care already included. To combat the issues posed by the MHPA, Congress passed the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) in 2008, and MHPAEA prohibited differences in treatment limits, cost sharing, and in- and out-of-network (Health Policy Brief). These two acts have made a world of a difference in the world of mental health care. Before these acts were passed, mental health care was only offered by a few plans, and this care came at a huge cost to workers. These acts changed that situation and this has helped their customers in an economic sense as well as by improving their health. According to D article Mission unfulfilled: potholes on the road to mental health parity, for behavioral health care services have been reduced at a faster pace than has been the case for general medical care Though general medical care continues to be very important, mental (or behavioral) health care also needs to be considered. In addition to the actual details and characteristics of mental parity, we must also consider the reasons that mental parity is important. Those who know someone with a debilitating mental illness may not agree with the idea that mental health is as important as physical health. However, mental illnesses can become invisible illnesses, considering they are not physically or physiologically visible. Because of this, many people may unknowingly have the disease and disregard the symptoms and therefore do not receive treatment. Research indicates that 10 percent of adults have anxiety disorder, yet it is estimated that only one-fourth of affected persons receive (Altrocchi, J., Antonuccio, D., Basta, R. & Danton, W.G.). Though these afflicted individuals may attempt to receive treatment through general medical practices, often these practices as effective. Often, general medical practitioners are aware of the pharmacological treatments to help the mentally ill, but not the therapeutic or behavioral practices. To truly receive the treatment they need in order to better themselves, they must receive assistance from those trained in mental health. The importance of this is shown by the shortage of mental health professionals in the U.S., and by the shocking statistics of suicides in America. Evidence has shown that 41% of adults in the U.S. with a mental health condition received mental health services in the past and is the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S., the 3rd leading cause of death for people aged and the 2nd leading cause of death for people aged (NAMI). If we took on a different view of mental health and treated it with more care and concern, perhaps these numbers would be different. In addition, if we as a society become more accepting of mental illness, the demand and supply of mental health care professionals may increase, which would also help the situation. Having shown you all the positive effects of mental parity, I must also acknowledge the possible drawbacks and arguments against this policy. A major reason for backlash against mental parity is that some people have a misconception that having this policy will increase the cost of health care. However, the National Business Group on Health observed through studies that mental parity will either cause no increase or a very small increase in the cost of health care ( Issue Brief : Parity). In addition, currently there are many indirect costs for mental health care that are currently being spent as people do not have the access to direct mental health care. Another argument against mental health parity is that current mental health care services are detrimental to the people that receive them. On the website for the Alliance for Human Protection, they consider studies that have shown that required debriefing for traumatized people can be harmful and the use of antidepressants (SSRIs) during pregnancy may cause neurological problems in (4 compelling Debriefing is a commonly used practice that does not have any scientific evidence that indicates it helps the victims, and neurological drugs should not be causing neurological issues. However, though these specific examples clearly have some negative consequences, mental health care is very beneficial overall. It is said that employees with mental health problems receive effective treatment, it can result in: lower total medical costs, increased productivity, lower absenteeism, and decreased disability (Mental Health Nothing will ever be without its flaws, and in this situation the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks in order for us to have a happy and healthy society. In conclusion, advocating for mental health parity is the most important thing we can do. To benefit the happiness and productivity of our society, as well as be as economically productive as we can, we must offer mental health care services to everyone, equally. Though we as citizens have direct control over the legislative actions that keep this policy in place and strengthen its impact, we may do our part to support it. The most important action we must take is to partake in these services and recommend to our loved ones to do the same. Mental illnesses are invisible, but let their recognition be invisible too.
