Student 1 Student Professor Jamie Thornton ENC 1102 05 March 2017 Finding Place in the Military In age women and men are seen, and advocated for, as equal members in society, this has come from great effort in the sixties and seventies when women were fighting for their place. However manual labor jobs, especially in the military, seem to be the last place where there are still arguments over the differences of men and women. This disagreement leads to many women being locked out of an entire sector of employment based on their sex. Although there has been great effort to equalize the treatment of both sexes, such as the work done by groups like SWAN, there are still restrictions that prevent women and men from certain career paths based on their sex, some have even argued that these restrictions have been placed here because of legitimate biological reasoning, such as groups like Sisters in Arms. However there may be opportunity to compromise by allowing people, regardless of gender, the ability to apply for any position as long as they meet universally held requirements. The points of view that are taken from these two stakeholders seem incompatible; however, the compromise of allowing women to apply for military positions with by the same standards of men can be implemented because both want women to be seen as equal, their needs met, and innate bias within the military abolished. SWAN seeks for equal treatment for all women in the military. They state that women are a fundamental and important part of the military. They want women to be seen as equal and given the same opportunities as men in the military. They want the needs of female soldiers to be met, such as for feminine hygiene products. Their essential premise is that women have the Student 2 ability to achieve the same levels of success as men, and therefore since they are the same, they should be treated with the same respect. The primary objective of Sisters in Arms is similar to SWAN, in that they seek equality in the military. They want all militaries to open up positions for women because they see women as being a vital form of diversity in the military, they think that women have a unique set of skills that they can offer, and although they may be different, they are of the same value. However they have acknowledged that limitations may be set because of the physical differences between men and women. They state observations and research which show that women always succeed in the military in the same way that men do, perhaps because of psychological reasons. They also cite the biological differences between men and women, for example on average men are stronger than women. They both wish to see women in the military in some form. They are both concerned about the treatment of women in the military. They both want women who are in the military to be respected and their needs met. Most importantly they both think that women have something to offer the military of value and they believe that by contributing to that fact they have earned the right for equal treatment. One major step taken originally was that women were equal but not entirely the same, therefore it was seen as fit to set different standards for them. It was decided that women would have to compete for the same job as a man with different standards; they would therefore set the limit for women lower than men. Many physically taxing positions in the military have lowered their physical requirements, for example they lowered the requirements of upper body strength, for women so that more women would be eligible to positions in the military. It was justified that the new requirements were suited proportionally to the body size of a woman. Student 3 This is not entirely fair, and in order for the proposed solution there will need to be compromises on both sides of the argument. SWAN will have to acknowledge that some positions have lowered standards for women which does not help them in combat positions and does not ensure they a prepared for the same positions as men. This is not justifiable in a combat setting and should not be considered a good position. This will need to be adjusted, which means that fewer women are likely to get into the military than was previously noted. This may be considered a grave loss, however those that do enter the military will have met the same requirements as men and can not be challenged on that fact. In positions like these, there should not be considered a of people of diversity that should be met, although there should definitely be an open environment that is tolerant of diversity; women should no longer feel threatened to apply for a military position and this change should not be marketed or advertised as a potential deterrent. However Sisters in Arms will have to concede that while there may be physical limitations between the sexes, there are women out there who can and will meet the same requirements that men do and should be given the same opportunity. It is fair to ascertain that they do believe in equality of the sexes, however generalizations that comes from arguments of our differences is not a universal truth and should be questioned. I suggest that they have equal base requirements for both men and women, that way anyone who is fully capable of fulfilling a position will be considered on completely equal and fair terms. It allows women to be eligible for every position that is currently available to men, and it treats them as equal participants. It takes under consideration that women may not always be able to meet the physical requirements of men, and allows them to undertake positions that they are capable of fulfilling. Ultimately this compromise will allow women to be treated equally and respectfully, in positions that they are fit to fulfill in the military. This will essentially be a Student 4 blind program, and there will be difficulties in lessening the potential bias that may already exist in people in the military today who deem soldiers as fit for a career in the military, especially in combat positions. Women will complete their training under the same circumstances as men, such as entering the same academy and training in the same courses. This will inforce the sense of equality as a something entirely reasonable because any male soldier that may have a bias against females will see them going through the same settings as them. This will potentially form a bond of pathos as well that will also inforce a sense of equality. This can also easily instill a sense of ethos as well, as that any soldiers that see bias arising in some situations may speak up in a sense of comradery of their fellow colleague. They will likely need to be evaluated in a blind judgement, where the evaluations of their training sessions and other testing scores are undertaken without consideration of their sex. This topic is important because it shows that there is still meaningful disparity between the sexes that are not being consulted properly. This solution will open up an entire sector of careers and employment to women. This proposed solution allows women to be treated in wholly equal terms as men, and ensures they have a place in the military that they have earned.
