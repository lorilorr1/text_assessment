Thorpe Geno Thorpe Professor Paquette ENC.1101.Composition 3/22/17 Free Tuition When you speak of going too college, your first thought is how will tuition be taken care of while attending school. College can be an expensive place, in which students can transition into the real world without being thrown in to fail. It gives that stepping-stone in order to help guide our new generation. Not all students are able to experience loans and certain funds to pay back tuition. Community College is a place where students should be able to receive free education because it can begin to help them understand the effects and ways of the real world. College is an institution that people attend to gain more intelligence and should be more available to obtain. There is no necessary age limit to attend college but statistically the ages consist of people twenty too twenty-nine years of old. Having tuition to pay is one of the biggest factors of why people do not attend college. Going to a college can be a new experience that helps young adults develop into a mature adult. Certain characteristics can be gained such as work skills, helping to receive a job, also providing more income due to the knowledge of that person degree. In our society, being the best version of you is something that most people strive to obtain. With community college being free, this would assist anyone to be able to receive a proper education. This will not hinder anyone for being the best version they can be. To fully understand the problem of tuition within colleges, we must understand Thorpe how many people in our society can afford college. In the year 2015 Edward Jones an analysis did a survey on who can afford college tuition. He later found that 83 percent of Americans say they cannot afford regular college tuition, more than half. College cost still continues to rise but there are still handfuls of students that have went to college and became successful afterwards. Having a college degree is very beneficial in a variety of different ways. A regular graduate with a degree is more likely to face unemployment and will more than likely earn more income then a high school graduate. prove that over a course of a lifetime, the average worker with a degree with earn approximately 1 million more than a worker without a postsecondary With the help in funds to those who are less fortunate, our world will be able to have more minds that are somewhat intelligent in order to have a bright and prosperous future for our generation. Attending college as a normal student has not been an easy transition for some people. It has turned into will I get my tuition Sitting down with a friend named Abby Fisher who attends the University of South Florida, I was able to ask her questions of her own experience as a Bull as well as tuition fees. Simply, it was easy for her to discuss her issues with her college experience. wish somebody in the staff could hit me, so they can add money to my She states. She also said that no matter what she does around the area matter anymore because I pay tuition at this university. It is going to cost me a After speaking to her I realized that this issue is giving students a pessimistic outlook on college that is not a place to learn, it is a place for students to get into debt, or a place you must come up with money in order to continue to be successful. More than half of the college enrollment comes out of school Thorpe in debt. How can any student in debt guarantee that they will have enough money to pay back their tuition. We as an entire country must help our students out of this mindset and into the mindset of let me make the most out of my future. The rate that college tuitions are headed yearly makes it almost impossible too convinces a student it is 100 percent worth it to go to college. Having free tuition for community college can cause students too abuse and take advantage of that privilege. Not every student that is granted the opportunity to attend college will take advantage of the situation. Young adults during the stage of college, may not make the best decisions for themselves long term. Students at this particular age tend to still be finding themselves as people and also there purpose in this world. People who go too college because they have too and not because they want too, usually abuse the privilege. At every level of education there are students who do not show a ton of interest in school. In college there are students who do not care too graduate and waste the funds that the government has given us for free. However, even with these people, we still have plenty of students who want to make our world a better place with their minds as well as creativity, but have no way to fund themselves through. If I were to have a resolution, making sure students take care of their schoolwork would be most important. Depending of the performance in the classroom could potentially extend their tuition scholarships. This way it gives them the chance to dictate their own journey and potential on how serious they are about their schooling. College tuition in our generation today is still a controversial topic. If tuition were free for community college it could give our students an option of pursuing a higher career, not to a point where they have to be hindered because they cannot afford it. This Thorpe could easily happen if there were more people in our society who cared about young students and there futures. In order to make our world better we must invest in our young people. Students already deal with enough schoolwork let alone working to make money in order to survive. There should be more talk of how we can help our and not just because they pay their full tuition.
