Blichasz 1 Joanie Blichasz Kristen Rouisse ENC 1102-103 16 April 2017 Let People have the Right to Choose Assisted suicide is defined as someone who assists or encourages another person to kill Are There are four major problems within this topic that needs to be confronted: that assisted suicide is illegal, determining competency to make this decision depending on his or her illness, it can be considered ethically wrong, and that it corrupts the practice of medicine and the doctor-patient relationship. The topic of physician assisted suicide has been debated over many years and out of the 50 states in the United States only six of them have legalized assisted suicide, California, Colorado, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and Montana Although this topic is a nationwide issue, in the United Kingdom there have been many people protesting to make assisted suicide legal. Therefore, since people do not have the right to choose when they want to end their life, people who have serious health conditions that could possibly need this in the future should protest against this right being illegal so that they will not have to suffer and can die peacefully. The forty-four states that have not legalized assisted suicide either have laws prohibiting it, no specific laws, or are unclear on the legality of it In the UK, assisted suicide is illegal under English law and Suicide Act 1961 makes it a criminal offence in England and Wales to: abet, counsel, or procure the suicide of another or an attempt of Blichasz 2 another to commit Are Dignity in Dying is a main organization in the UK that fights for the right to let people choose when they want to die because they believe that if death is already imminent then why should people suffer in the first place. This organization believes that if one is terminally ill and is of sound mind to make the decision to die, then they should be able to have that right. The other three major problems within assisted suicide that needs to be addressed all connect to why it is illegal. When it comes to determining competency to make the decision to die depending on his or her illness, it can become a problem because they might not be in the right state of mind to come to such a decision. However, those who are dying have neither the choice to live or die, they are not suicidal. If they have less than six months to live, or are in serious pain, and death is inevitable and they are suffering then they deserve the choice whether to fight through it or control the timing and manner of their Therefore, competency relates to the reason that assisted suicide is illegal because people believe that if one is dying, no matter the illness, then they cannot be of right mind to make the decision to die. However, they not only want to help themselves by ending their suffering but they can also help their family members as well. It can help family members because then they do not have to watch a member of their family going through so much pain, and instead just die peacefully without going through each day watching someone that you love suffer, knowing that you cannot do anything to help them other than watch and hope that it ends quickly. Another problem when determining competency is that they might not be capable of making such decisions because of their illness, but as humans we know that they are most likely in excruciating pain and therefore, others might want to make the decision for them such as family members or someone that is professionally trained to determine their condition, such as a doctor. If people can realize that if the one dying Blichasz 3 wants it to end for both themselves and their family, then that mean that they are competent enough to make such decisions. An article by Claire Andre and Manuel Velasquez talk about the ethical and moral reasons that come with assisted suicide. In the article, Claire and Manuel express that although medical developments have been rapidly increasing, which means that more lives can be saved, it has also given us the technology sustain (or, some would say, prolong the deaths) of patients whose physical and mental capabilities cannot be restored, whose degenerating conditions cannot be reversed, and whose pain cannot be Some people would think that preserving life is fine because as a society we have a moral duty to do so, however, others would think that this is cruel, to prolong a life that is in pain. People think that assisted suicide is ethically wrong because as human beings we live by morals that govern our behavior, and helping someone die goes against everything we were taught growing up. However, as humans everybody has moral right to choose freely what they will do with their lives as long as they inflict no harm on (Claire and Manuel). Claire and Manuel mention that society committed to preserving and protecting life should not commission people to destroy This sentence in the article is not wrong however, some see it as helping or assisting, not as destroying life. They might believe that helping them end their suffering is better than doing nothing, since it is inevitable that they will die. Ethical reasons relate to assisted suicide being illegal because our behavior as humans, we have moral obligations that are deep rooted in everyone, therefore a law that makes assisting in suicide illegal is something that would be expected, however, as previously stated, as human beings we also have a moral right to freely choose what we do with our lives as long as no one else is hurt. Blichasz 4 The final problem that needs to be addressed is how it can corrupt the practice of medicine and doctor-patient relationship. When one thinks of medicine, they think of doctors and the oath that they took to protect and save life. When it comes to the oath, the Hippocratic Oath, everyone knows the phrase do no which encompasses that you will not harm anyone, including taking life. Because of this oath assisted suicide is seen as corrupting the practice of medicine because as doctors or even nurses they are supposed to save life not harm them, however, if one is clearly suffering then they have a say if a patient wants to die. Doctor-patient relationships can be a problem that needs to be addressed because if a doctor becomes close with a certain patient and does not want to see them suffer then they might assist them in suicide especially if that patient wants it as well. Consequences of failing to actively confront this problem is that somebody could assist in death and since it is illegal then they could go to jail, possibly for life, depending on where they live and the court ruling. Another consequence is that is that it could possibly overload the health care or hospice system with patients who did not want to be there, if given the choice. However, in order to prevent such things from happening people who have a serious health condition and might need this service, of getting to choose the time and manner in which they die, in the future should protest for the rights to be able to make assisted suicide legal. Protesting can also include signing a petition, spreading the word, or donating to organizations, such as Dignity in Dying, so that they can hire a lobbyist to go to Congress and fight on their behalf to get assisted suicide legalized. Everyone can also educate others on assisted suicide and show them the pros and cons so that they can make an informed decision instead of one that is just based off of ethics and opinions formed by society.
