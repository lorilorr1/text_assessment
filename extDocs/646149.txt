Oleksandr Buhaievskyi Ms. Ashely Tisdale ENC 1101 February 5. 2017 Public opinion in USSR Different generations of people have significantly separate meanings about socialism and USSR in general, younger generation view socialism as historical period of time and strong governmental control under the people, while older generations had experienced it and they look at socialism as an uncompleted governmental system, that become broken because of lazy people. Young generations have seen socialism fractionally and partially it was dictator administration, people follow European or American style of clothing, they have businesses and travel to other countries, that were not in Soviet Union. Every citizen of USSR had same salary, same living condition, expect people in government. Middle generations of people who lived in Socialism, seen USSR inside and when it broke up in 1991, they were charged another people for it. Example: Bus Driver, worked for Mining he would have been pouring diesel from the tank of his bus to some landing, and was manually changing millage on bus speedometer, to make illusion of him working, when he People with different degree, have big choice for work, they had same salary. While Manager spend five years in University, after graduation he got same salary as cleaner in hotel. This governmental system perfect and led beginning of corruption, after broke up USSR.

In one of the problems of ideological symbol, is difference between school for rich and poor students, national identity started play role on schools, people were marked differently from American or European. Changes were on economical market and on government, socialism collapse and people got opportunity to have own businesses and be independent. National identity started play a critical role in facilities for rich and poor people. This article show the conflict that happened during the last decade and explains ideological changes, that happened on government and labor market. Countries got a President and Ministers, big changes on police and educational system, including changing a way of teaching history. After broke up in USSR, labor market got low prices, while most of businesses just got started. National identity was playing big role at that time, because it was entry for work and good relationship in University. For personal independence, some people opened own companies or businesses, to increase income in family capital and rise economy of country, because of taxes.
