However, as scarcity of natural capitals becomes a national issue, the U.S. has to face the challenge of balancing the energy supply, environment and economy. American Petroleum Institute(API) is an organization supporting the exploitation and marketing of oil and natural gas the US. American Council On Renewable Energy(ACORE), however, is an organization dedicating to the promotion of renewable energy such as solar energy, biomass fuels and so on. These two organization seem to be in a strong disagreement over energy supply because ACORE believes renewable energy can make the society sustainable by minimizing its impacts on the environment, while API has always convinced that fossil fuels is the most affordable and feasible way to satisfy the energy demands in the country. Nonetheless, even with different beliefs, these two organizations both have a common goal which is to meet the domestic or even international need for energy. Therefore, it is possible to establish a comprehensive system which synthesizes renewable energy and traditional energy. Fossil fuels have been the most common resource for energy supply since the Industrial Revolution because they are easy to be exploited and refined, and affordable to most energy consumers. American Petroleum Institute is a loyal supporter of this kind of traditional energy. API promotes the economy by developing oil exploration, exploitation, transportation and marketing. Besides, they also play their important political role as they lobby for petroleum and negotiate with federal and state governments. Their mission statement is promote safety across the industry globally and to influence public policy in support of a strong, viable U.S. oil and natural gas Petroleum Instiute) One of major accomplishments is the standardization of petroleum products, which has been adopted by more than 100 countries. However, influence not only just come from their professional and political persuasion, but also come from the practicability of petroleum itself. Many people are concerned about the reserves of fossil fuels since many data have shown these natural resources cannot be consumed indefinitely, however, as the technology advances, more reserves have been discovered or rebuilt. In fact, with the implement of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, the oil production has actually increased over the year, rather than depleted. According to Covert et al, oil and gas reserves expanded 59 and 94 percent, respectively, between 2000 and 2014. This technology-driven growth in reserves also caused increases in production. In 2014, US natural gas production was greater than ever before and oil production was at 97 percent of the peak reached in (122) With the increase of oil production, the heavy dependence of fossil fuels is not likely to decrease shortly as the price is currently unbeatable in the market. Covert et al also suggest that electricity sector consumes over 90 percent of total coal consumption and 30 percent of natural (126) Considering the uneven population distribution and high demand for energy, state and federal governments have to choose the most viable energy supply which can not only cover the inhabited regions but also fit the financial qualifications. Differently, ACORE mainly focuses on the sustainability of resources as well as their impacts on the environment. Their mission is business, policy and finance to accelerate the transition to a renewable energy Council On Renewable Energy) ACORE contributes immeasurably towards the development of renewable energy. Their educational projects and publications educate people with solid information while remaining accessible and free to the public. ACORE opposes to the over-exploitation of natural resources as well as oil drilling adopted by petroleum supporters like API, such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, because they believe these drilling methods have caused tremendous damages to residential areas and wildlife habitats. These negative effects include water contamination, noise, earthquakes and so on. For example, according to journal Professional Safety, water may be contaminated through spillage and improperly built and maintained waste (18) Therefore, renewable energy, which is generated from clean and renewable sources, seems to be a better options for countries with high energy demands. ACORE and their peers believe it is possible to replace traditional energy with clean energy in the US as many countries have put it into practice. For instance, researchers Mathiesen at el suggest and Norway generate all their electricity using renewable energy already, and many other countries have the set a goal to reach 100% renewable energy in the (148) Despite the existence of conflicts, these two organizations share a mutual goal that they both want to meet the demand of energy supply in this country. API wants to supply energy with low-cost resources since affordable resources require relatively low tax rates and investment, however, they do acknowledge fossil fuels are not unlimited and could have negative effects on the environment. On the other hand, although clean energy is almost free of pollution, they still need more investment and might be difficult to be generalized in big countries comparing to fossil fuels. Thus, establishing an energy system that combines both types of energy might be a feasible option for both stakeholders to thrive in the energy market. In fact, some companies and institutes have developed a new energy synthesized from both fossil fuels and renewable sources. These renewable sources include biomass and agricultural products, wastes, even like tires. Similarly a synthetic gas called syngas produced by natural gas and other chemical components such as hydrogen, has also been used by many factories and agriculture industries. These synthetic resources share common characteristics: low-cost (comparing to purely renewable energy), easy to be produced, and less detrimental to the environment. Economically, synthetic fuels can be competitive with fossil fuels when further policies are established. Study conducted by Tarka et al suggests that plants equipped with CCS(carbon capture and sequestration) are competitive at crude oil prices as low as $86 per barrel and have less life cycle GHG(greenhouse gas) emissions than petroleum-derived diesel(1). Environmentally, Tarka et al also suggest that with CCS has a 9-15% reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to that of petroleum derived Moreover, companies developing synthetic energy, such as Synthetic Energy System has developed machines with high efficiency which can produce syngas more efficiently. These two organizations have their interests in different fields, and yet they both want to motivate the development of the society. With the gradual adoption and implement of synthetic energy, it is possible for these two organizations and their peers to join this new market and work collaboratively. To make the compromise feasible, these two stakeholders have to share the energy market and work together to make the energy cleaner and cheaper. If synthetic energy becomes the main source of energy in the future, it will not only cover most(or even all) residential regions, but also cause less harmful effects to wildlife and the environment.
