Potter 1 Harry Potter ENC 1102 Kristen Rouisse 22 February, 2017 Underage Drinking Drinking irresponsibly is something that must come to an end, and Mothers against Drunk Driving (MADD) could not agree more. MADD is not only against drunk driving and underage drinking, but they are also against drug driving. MADD has sponsors like the NFL, State farm, Uber, and much more to help support the foundation. Also, the MADD explains that because of the drinking age being twenty-one it has saved 25,000 lives in the U.S (Mothers against Drunk Driving). According to Joyce Alcantara, people who begin drinking before ages 15 are four times more likely to develop alcoholism than those who begin drinking at (Drinking Age Debate: The drinking age should stay at 21 to protect teens). MADD gives many facts to help support the ending of underage drinking, drunk driving, and drug driving. This stakeholder mainly hopes to end underage drinking by promoting powerful and meaningful ads for the youth of America. To begin, image one portrays exactly what MADD is wanting the Youth of America to understand. The image explains what exactly can happen when American youth drink. It appeals to the youth of America by showing a young teen in the image. The image makes since without the words at the bottom of the screen but the words do help the image be understandable. It is trying to appeal to logos when it states, make it a grad to saying that if you die after graduation, you will literally forget it. There are many emotions that come from this image including: sadness, sympathy, and guiltiness. The sadness is because the teen is shown dead after Potter 2 a crash from drunk driving. The sympathy that is felt, is from knowing that the parents must deal with the death of their child from drinking. Lastly, the guiltiness that comes from this image is knowing that the youth that have drank irresponsibly were blessed to not have an accident like this. The image also adds the logo of MADD to help give the image some credibility or ethos.

In the image, it shows a girl in a graduation gown, meaning the time setting of the image is around graduation. This gives a sense of time which is in reference to Kairos. The only possible problem with this image is that the words at the bottom of the image are too small and need to be larger. Also, it does not exactly say or show that the dead teen was drinking, and it should be clearer on how she died. The colors that are used in image one are to put the attention on the teen girl being dead. As stated by Cameron Chapman, red can be associated with anger and indicates danger (Color Theory for Designers, Part 1: The Meaning of Color).

This image wants to show danger and sadness to understand the issue of underage drinking. Furthermore, image two explains what underage drinking can do to the Youth of America. The audience that the image is directing to is the ages between sixteen and twenty.

This statement not only lets us know what audiences it is appealing to but also appealing to logos. be and, work has saved nearly 300,000 lives and also appeal to logos by stating this in the image. The image appeals to credibility or ethos by putting the logo of MADD and website at the bottom right of the image (Mothers against Drunk Driving).
