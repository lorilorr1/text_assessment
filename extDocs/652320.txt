Panton1 Patrick Panton Instructor Ryan ENC1102.001 13 February 2017 Finding common ground on the Ethnics of Abortion Abortion is the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy, most often performed during the first 28 weeks of pregnancy. The debatable controversy is based on the ethics of abortion which states that abortion whether it can be morally right to terminate a pregnancy before normal childbirth. Views on abortion is always negative that abortion is wrong. However, some think that abortion is right when the life is at risk, if the sexually abused or the affordability of the continuation of the child life is not possible. This seem to be a major problem in modern society. A major organization that believes that abortion is necessary is Abortion Access Project, they work together with health and social service providers and agencies to better respond to patients and clients experiencing unintended pregnancy. This organization do not believe that life should be created unintentional or if it endangers the mother. 40 days of life a religious group believe that community-based campaign that takes a determined, peaceful approach to showing local communities the consequences of abortion in their own neighborhoods, for their own friends and families. It puts into action a desire to cooperate with God in the carrying out of His plan for the end of abortion. It draws attention to the evils of abortion. Based on the difference views that are incorporated, these two groups are at odds. Although both groups are not performing the action of abortion they have different views on the ethics of abortion. Though the jargon on the ethics of abortion is spewed by both sides and both organization, Abortion Access project and 40 days of Panton2 life can break the current impasses by acting on building a committee imposed of both members to overcome the issue. Perhaps most importantly each still maintains its identity but gains integrity through this compromise. Regarding the first stake holder, 40 days of life, their main goals are focused on a pro-life campaign with regards to the various age groups with a vision to access power through prayer, fasting, and peaceful vigil to end abortion. They are anti-abortion and believe that discarding a child is against will and committing such act is sinful. Their believes are not the only ones that are present in society. In the article never to have been born Christians Ethics, Anti-Abortion Politics, and the Pro-life written by Dan Thomas demonstrates the common belief that Christians have towards abortion it deals with the irrational decision of mothers to have the open mind to be able to forgo the birth of a child. According to the article, Dan Thomas states practitioners have perversely and paradoxically saved millions of unborn souls by removing human volition from the equation and by making it possible for the unborn to experience the joys of heaven without the temptations of (Thomas,1). This quote relates to what 40 days of life mission statement states it aids to stop abortion through prayer fasting and peaceful vigil which is common to what Mr. Thomas is saying towards Abortion practitioners. The article and 40 days of life both are prolife and empathizes with each other on the topic of Anti-Abortion. However, Abortion access project, which is pro-abortion organization believes that engaging trusted care providers and empowering them with information and skills about abortion is a critical opportunity to improve coordination of care for women seeking abortion, when these services are needed. This organization consist of mostly women, empowering other women Panton3 through various speeches, they express the opportunities that they may have when an abortion is needed, if they are struggling on their selves. This organization also emphasizes programs to females who has been rape victim or cannot afford to have a child. They stress the need for the use of contraceptives. Various organizations and individuals also have common views on the ethics of abortion that are pro-abortion. According to an article deals with the issue of reclaiming abortion rights written by Katha Pollitt deals with the political point of view of the ethnical abortion. The article explains how women are being slaughtered and being violated because of their choice to have abortions, Katha Pollitt states who have stillbirths or miscarriages are being arrested for their conduct during (Pollitt,10). This quote state that women are being violated against their rights because of supposedly misconduct during their tri semester periods. 40 days of life is for women rights which would suggest similar reactions in the organization. This organization holds the firm believe that women has rights and should hold the ability to express their views on abortion without the law being opposed on them. 40 days of life believes in pro-abortion and Katha Pollitt article solidifies the various reasons why the ethnics on pro-abortion should be granted. Despite these clear differences there are similarities that can be drawn on to make a common ground. The common ground is that both stakeholders are dealing with the matter that women who have or want an abortion are ones that are incapable of handling the birth of that child even if through rape victims or women who were unprotected through sexual intercourse. Both groups have the understanding value that a woman that has a birth that she does not want is a challenge and has difficulties. How that difficulty is resolved is based on the view of a religious or prochoice perspective. The audience or the reasons why these organizations(stake holders) were created was because women needed aid with a particular problem. Both groups agree that women Panton4 who are placed in the position of destroying a life or creating a life has an enormous decision that a single person should not take by themselves. Both group has come to a compromise. Abortion access project and 40 days of life may firstly develop a committee of both members from each organization. Secondly both groups will create a charity fund which will be used to aid in the development and spacing of multiple adoptions homes. Both groups have decided that creating a life is wonderful but what will happen with that life, if there is no one to love and nourish the path of that child. Hence the solution was to discourage abortion except if the mother will experience fatal injuries during birth otherwise adoption is always a path for mothers who are seeking abortion. Both groups, values and mission statements have not changed. The only changed that happened is the solution to the problem, that both groups are willing to take. According to the article and children the author stated the main reason for children being adopted was because their parents were unable or unwilling to care for (25) this statement signifies that adoption is a useful way that both groups can agree on and can understand the beliefs of each group can come to an equal understanding with its identity being maintained but gains integrity through this compromise. This can provide one way that a mother can create and not destroy life by giving the opportunity of life to a next individual that wants to nourish and love that child and cannot do so by themselves. Both stakeholders started off with different solutions to the same problem, abortion access project and 40 days of life have found common ground where both believe that women that are placed in a difficult position should not be alone in deciding whether to create or destroy life. Both stake holders compromise and the decision was to combined resources to aid in a charity fund to better off existing adoption homes and aid in the making of other adoption homes.
