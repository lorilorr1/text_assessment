Yanmark Martin Martin 1 Kristen Rouisse ENC 1102 January 29, 2017 Animal Captivity Animal captivity is a topic that has been talked about ever since animals were first put into cages or zoos in the 1800s. Just like any topic you have people that are for animal captivity and you also have people who are against it. Two of the major stakeholders that you think of when you think of animal captivity are Peta or People for Ethical Treatment of Animal and Seaworld. Peta is one of the biggest animal rights activist groups that are against any kind of unjust treatment of animals or what they see as unjust treatment of animals. Then on the other side we have SeaWorld that is an internationally recognized for bringing animals in and helping them stay away from people or things that want to hurt them. Since Peta and SeaWorld are both corporations that both want what they believe is best for animals they should work together to pave the way for a better animal policies for zoos around the world. If SeaWorld could move all of its orcas to a seaside sanctuary then it would solve both of the problems at once. Peta or People for Ethical Treatment of Animals were founded in March of 1980 by Ingrid Newkirk and Alex Pacheco. It was founded on this principal that was found on website Animals are not ours to eat, wear, experiment on, use for entertainment, or abuse in any other  Since it was founded in 1980, it has become one of the most active and most supported animal activist groups out there with more than 5 million supporters. Peta is against any kind of cruel treatment of animals ranging from keeping them in cages to having animals bred for the specific purpose of selling them. They feel like if they educate the public to all of the things that animals go through in zoos and other places that they can make a real difference in the way animals are treated. Even though some people believe that Peta is doing a lot of good for animal right, others believe that methods to get change may be a little extreme. SeaWorld was founded on March 15, 1959 and it was founded by Ken Norris, George Millay, David DeMott, and Milt Shedd but its first park did not open its doors until 1964 in San Diego. SeaWorld has been dedicated to helping animals as stated in this quote from their website more than 50 years, we have been a leading theme park and entertainment company delivering personal, interactive and educational experiences that blend imagination with nature and enable our guests to celebrate, connect with and care for the natural world we SeaWorld has done a very nice job educating the public about some animals that we may have never even seen before if it for SeaWorld bringing them to its park. For example not a lot of information was known about orca whales before SeaWorld brought them to their park and once at the park we learned more about them. However SeaWorld has come under scrutiny after the release of a movie titled which came out in 2013 and basically exposes how SeaWorld treats its orcas. SeaWorld and Peta both want the animals to be healthy and they also want the animals to be in the best possible shape they can be in. However even though SeaWorld and Peta want what is best for the animals they are approaching it in two very different ways. SeaWorld wants to put the animals on display to the public so that the public can learn more about these majestic animals we live with. Peta on the other hand wants to basically let all the animals free from their enclosures and cages so they can roam free in the wild with no human interaction. SeaWorld and Peta do not see eye to eye in the matter of animal welfare because of the fact that they believe in such different ways for animals to get what is best for them. Peta launched an anti SeaWorld ad/campaign which claims that any orca or marine mammal has not lived up to the maximum age of those that live in the wild. As it is stated on the SeaWorld of hurt website, wild male orcas live an average of 30 years and up to 60 years and females an average of 50 years and up to more than 100, 38 orcas have died on watch at an average age of only 13. Not one has reached the maximum lifespan of an orca in nature. More than 100 other dolphins have also died, alongside countless other Although Peta and SeaWorld have not come together in the past does not mean that they can not come back together in the future with a compromise. SeaWorld and Peta are at odds with one another but with a compromise that works for both of them it could put this war to an end. The compromise would be that if SeaWorld would move all of its orcas from their enclosures in the SeaWorld premises to a sanctuary in the ocean with enough space for them to swim freely Peta will drop its anti SeaWorld campaign. This compromise works for Peta because it gets what it wants by not having the orcas living in small enclosed spaces. Then SeaWorld can get what it wants because Peta will drop its anti SeaWorld campaign and attendance may rise again. This compromise has worked in the past when the National Aquarium moved all of its orcas to a seaside sanctuary and it was praised for this move. The implication of this idea is not very hard because in 2015 the National Aquirum started this project with just $200,000 and SeaWorld was offered $2 million by Peta and others to do this an offer that SeaWorld refused. Also since in 2016 SeaWorld was forced to end its whale breeding program so it have very many whales left so why not move them to this sanctuary so they can live out the rest of their lives there. SeaWorld would most likely be praised for a move like this also and it will also end any scrutiny of whales living in concrete enclosures for good. Overall this is a decision that is up to these two corporations to decide what they want to do but from the looks of it we may not get a resolution from either of these companies in the coming years.
