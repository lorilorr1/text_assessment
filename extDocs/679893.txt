Student 1 Student Kimber Wiggs ENC 1101 5 March 2017 The developing process of Non-English Speaker Education Nowadays, more and more international students who are Non-English speakers choose to go abroad to study in English-speaking countries, like the United States, Canada, and Australia. As we all known, the language barrier is one of the biggest problems during studying abroad. With the craze for studying abroad, the universities pay attention to establish studying support to help Non-English speakers study English. Although the ultimate goal for English language program is helping second language students learning English, the focus has changed from to within the last decade. Many research showed the general department at the beginning of the ten-year span. In 2003, Ken, Sandra and Stephanie investigated that students still using the traditional language support, which supported from the university learning assistance centers, to access to education of learning English. The traditional language supports are always consist of short courses, self- access materials and summer schools. The observation shows that most students are still engage in content- based courses to help learning English. There are three characteristics for content- based courses, general lecture followed by ESL students having a specific tutorial with an ESL options, counting for credit, designed to teach some program content along with specific language and run specifically for ESL student and taught by lecturers with both subject and ESL From the characteristics, traditional language supports are still revolve around the general part of learning the English, which are not Student 2 detailed enough for Non-English speakers. Similarly to this result, the research from Chen in 2008 focuses on the preference for discourse pattern of Chinese ESL students. The investigation compares the preferences of Chinese ESL students and native speakers when they writing a discourse in English. The deductive pattern is appeared to be a Western preference, and Chinese prefer to use the inductive pattern in discourse (Chen 188). Furthermore, Chen started to focus on the culture and a specific part when Non-English speakers learning English. However, it still restrict to the academic and professional form. Something has changed during the end of last decade as well. response to the increasing numbers of second language (L2) learners studying n Canadian universities, many new language programs have been (Fox, Cheng & Zumbo 58). The goal of the new developing L2 English language is still to support the successful transition to and engagement with academic work in university, which is same with Chen and Ken. However, there is a huge difference happened in Fox, they considerably in emphasis, methodology, and approach (Fox, Cheng & Zumbo 58). There are two types of programs showed in Fox, the first one is English as a second language (ESL; general English), and the second on is English for academic purposes (EAP). According to Fox, The ESL are typically related to improve communicative capability and tend to social interaction, while the EAP concentrates more on help Non-English speakers adapt the academic systems. Evidently, social communication capability becomes the new emphasis of learning English for Non-English speakers. Because of the popularity of English and the desire of study abroad, there are rapid growth of education institution in Non-English speakers local country. They practice grammar, training writing skills before they came to the English speaking country. However, most people are afraid to talking because their poor pronunciation when they first came to the speaking country. Thus, improving Student 3 the communication skills became the new specific difficulty to overcome for Non-English speakers. According to the article written in 2015, Non-English speakers education became a cultural continuity in international higher education for second English speakers. The English language programs are put in a specified cultural environment. The culture collision breeds an emergent significant feature of the culture (Yang & Chen 197). The original culture of Non- English speakers will not be denied, it will become the transportation between English culture and the original culture. Overall, the goal for Non-English speaker education has remained a constant of helping second English language students adapt English with the continued developing of emphasis from to Over the span of the last decade, from 2003 to 2015, universities keep provide English learning supporting, like ESL, EAP courses, to help Non-English speakers from every aspect. Moreover, with the developing of technology and popularization of social media, universities have more methods to teaching English with the various requirements of the times. Thus, it is reasonable to agree that this particular developing of Non-English speaker education changed from general to specific with the times.
