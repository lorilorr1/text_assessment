Carandang 1 Elyssa Carandang Professor DeCarion ENC 1102.086 14 February 2017 Alcohol Consumption: Is Age Really Necessary? Countries all over the world implement different laws regarding alcohol consumption. The legal drinking age in Europe is 18, whereas the legal drinking age in the United States is 21. There has been controversy on whether or not the legal drinking age should be lowered in the United States. An organization that believes that there should be no change towards the legal drinking age is Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD). This nonprofit organization is devoted to ending all acts of drunk driving and underage drinking. Although MADD believes that the legal drinking age in America is beneficial, there are organizations like the National Youth Rights Organization who believe that the legal drinking age should be lowered. This organization believes that the age restriction on alcohol consumption does not affect the high rates of drunk driving incidents. Despite the fact that both of these organizations have different views on the legal drinking age in the United States, they both want to ensure the safety of people whenever alcohol plays a factor. With careful consideration, Mothers Against Drunk Drivers and the National Youth Rights Organization should come together and create a compromise that allows certain establishments to allow young adults at the age of 18 to legally consume alcohol. Mothers Against Drunk Drivers is a nonprofit organization whose mission statement is aid the victims of crimes performed by individuals driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, to aid the families of such victims and to increase public awareness of the problem of drinking and drugged (MADD). Since society is not fully aware of the dangers of drunk Carandang 2 driving, MADD is devoted to spreading drunk driving awareness while comforting families who have been tragically impacted. This organization was originally founded by Candace Lightner after her daughter was killed in a hit-and-run drunk driving accident in 1980 (Friedrich). Because of this tragic accident, certain precautions have been taken to ensure the safety of civilians. In 1984, the United States Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act which punished states who allowed underage alcohol possession (New York Times). Patricia Melody Loewit-Phillips and Abbie Goldbas wrote an article about MADD and their impact on society. Loewit-Phillips and Goldbas stated that of the greatest victories of lobbyists may have been the enactment of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21 st (Loewit- Philips & Goldbas 64). The TEA-21 requires all states to enforce the Blood Alcohol Content laws in order to keep their federal highway funding. Throughout the years, MADD has been slowly successful in lowering the drunk driving rate through their Campaign to Eliminate Drunk Driving. This campaign consists of three steps: support our hearos, sober to start, and secure the feature (MADD). Because of their avid belief in keeping innocent lives at risk from drunk drivers, Mothers Against Drunk Driving the 21 Minimum Legal Drinking Age (MLDA) because it saves lives, prevents injuries, and protects still-developing (MADD). 13,000 lives were perished due to an irresponsible individual driving under the influence. With the 21 MLDA intact, MADD hopes that drunk driving will slowly cease in existence. In contrast to MADD believing that underage drinking is a serious matter that needs to be addressed, the NYRA believes that the drinking age should be lowered. National Youth Rights Association is a youth-led civil rights organization in the United States promoting youth (NYRA). The 10,000 members of this organization avidly fight for allowing youths to have more rights. mission is to achieve its goals Carandang 3 through educating people about youth rights, empowering young people to work on their own behalf in defense of their rights, and taking positive steps to lessen the burden of (NYRA). One issue NYRA is known to focus on is the legal drinking age. The NYRA firmly believes that the legal drinking age in the United States should be lowered to the age of 18. Brandon Griggs, news editor of CNN, has also reflected on this question, as to whether or not the United States should lower the drinking age. In his article, Griggs started his introduction with the opinion of Dwight B. Heath, an anthropology professor at Brown University. Heath believes that parents should give a small amount of alcohol to their children so that they become more educated with the substance and not underage drink in rebellion as teenagers (Griggs). The NYRA has a similar opinion as to why the drinking age should be lowered in the United States. The NYRA believes that people must be allowed to get their feet wet through the introduction of alcohol in small amounts in safe environments like the (NYRA). Even though the NYRA wants more teens to have legal access to alcohol, they still recognize the dangerous effects it could have on an individual. The National Youth Rights Association pointed out that danger of alcohol is real and go away when someone turns (NYRA). Even though there are law that implement 21 as the legal drinking age, the president of Middlebury College, John McCardell Jr., pointed out the horrible reality: drinking taking place behind closed doors, where much more dangerous. out of step with social (Griggs). Mothers Against Drunk Driving and the National Youth Rights Association have different views on whether or not the drinking age should be lowered. These two non-profit organizations have not come to a resolution to this controversial topic since they both want the exact opposite of the other organization. However, they both want to ensure the safety of Carandang 4 innocent civilians that are in the presence of intoxicated individuals. One possible compromise both non-profit organizations could consider is allowing certain local establishments to allow young adults at the age of 18 to legally consume and possess alcohol. The main reason why MADD is against lowering the drinking age because it would put more lives at risk if a teen were driving under the influence. If young adults are able to drink in local establishments, they would be able to enjoy the side effects of alcohol in a safe environment. The employees there would ensure the safety of those who are intoxicated and completely sober. This compromise would please the members of the NYRA since it would allow 18 year olds to have the right to consume alcohol. The SpeakUP! Prevention Coalition has pointed out that the higher drinking age, the level of automobile crashes and fatalities related to drinking is higher in the [United than other (SpeakUP!). With most compromises, one or both stakeholders in the conflict have to sacrifice something that they believe in in order to make a truce with one another. Letting young adults at the age of 18 start drinking in local establishments may seem dangerous at first. However, by doing this, teenagers are less likely to be in possession of alcohol illegally and will cause less car accidents to driving under the influence. In the end, alcohol consumption is an unpredictable thing. It could harm someone in unthinkable ways and could turn someone into a completely different person. Nevertheless, letting rebellious teenagers have access to alcohol consumption could convert their rebellious behavior into responsible young adults. Carandang 5 Works Cited Griggs, Brandon.
