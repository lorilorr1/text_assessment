Araimi 1 Hamed Al Araimi Gregory Van Winkle ENC 1102 26 February 2017 Video Games and Violence Lately, the world is experiencing numerous tragedies due to violence. People misuse guns and other weapons of assault to harm people intentionally. Different groups have varied opinions on the causes of violence. Some people believe it is due to the constitutional rights granted to citizens to own and handle arms while others blame it on the upbringing of the people committing these violent attacks. It is believed that children copy what they see in their environment. If their parents are not keen enough to determine what their children are exposed to, later on, they may face a rude awakening. The Conservative Daily News is among those who support the 2nd amendment but blame characters on the reason for their extreme violence (Joseph 132). On The Conservative Daily News website, they strongly agree with the second amendment and show their stance in the first image depicting violence in video games as the reason for violence in the real world, while the second image shows how an individual is stupid because they react quickly and oppose the second amendment. The first image is a representation on the Conservative Daily News (CDN) website. Like other media representing conservative interests, CDN favors gun rights and does not believe in blaming guns for violence in society. Rather, conservatives believe in blaming the behavior of the person holding the gun. Conservative media often links bad behavior to a poor upbringing and a general attitude of permissiveness in society. Figure 2 also a guy with a second amendment picket sign crossed out with an arrow pointing down to his knee showing writing that explains how Araimi 2 protesters have knee jerk reactions. This image is claiming people are stupid because they overreact when violence occurs and blame it on the second amendment right. The first image (figure 1) presents a satirical take on the problem of raising nonviolent children. The mother claims society is not doing enough to curb gun violence while her child is in the foreground, right in front of her, cursing and using violent language as he presses away on the gaming keypads like a wild-eyed maniac and crazy child (CDC 4). The child is playing a video game and cursing with violent language in front of both of his parents. The cartoon conveys two related ideas: 1, that it is a job to raise kids properly and 2, that violence in society is more attributable to violent influences, such as video games, rather than the mere presence of guns. Children tend to copy some characters from their learning environment. If they are occasionally exposed to violent behaviors as they grow up, they will tend to become violent once they are grown up. Among the causes of such behaviors is exposure to video games and cartoons containing violent scenes. It is a restatement of the old National Rifle Association line, do not kill people, people kill The second figure supports this claim by portraying caution words on the left leg of the cartoon. It supports the bearing of arms by individuals but what it shows is that those who are against them have a little sense and just react and blame it on the guns. Both images present ethos in their messages. The first image establishes an ethical tone by appealing to the concern about violence in society and the lack of parents attentiveness to their children playing violent video games. It assumes the agreement that we need to do something about violence simply because eliminating violence is the ethical thing to do if we want to avoid more violence. (John 46). In contrast, we have the highly unethical tone and language of the boy playing the video game. The image is credible because the parents are normal looking people sitting in a typical living room, having a typical parental conversation. The second image Araimi 3 introduces ethos through the purposeful presentation of its message and the idea behind it. The image presented here is outstanding even though it does not talk about video games directly; ethics here is all about gun control. It is in the hands of individual people to make proper use of such guns and shows how people react. In the first image, the mother is a reading a newspaper with a bold front page headline about the Sandy Hook (Newtown) school shooting which would immediately stir the emotions of readers (John 46). The use of the color pink for the skin suggests that he is extremely agitated as he plays the game with intensity. The kids bugged out eyes gives him the kind of crazed look that would likely arouse fear in readers if they saw it on the face of someone they encountered on the street. The abusive language also describes the intensity with which the boy plays the video game and implies that he might be likely to use similar language when communicating with people who provoke him. The wrinkles on the face show anger even as the parents in the background express sadness and helplessness. Also, the space between the parents and the child suggests the loneliness and alienation. In the second image illustrates pathos through the soothing message that the second amendment is something great and necessary for the citizens. The image is well frame to drive its message home. Those who are picketing are weak as the image portrays. This is an attractive style for any supporter of guns rights as they get easily convinced to want to own one. In addition to the several aspects of the images, the element of logos is evident. The company knows how to attract the attention of its readers. People can easily deduce the logic present in both images and relate with their routine lives. In the first image, the appeal to logic occurs in the ironic of the argument against the violent scene that is unfolding right in front of her. This seems to be a cry for common sense: As if to say, so concerned about violence, why you keep an eye on your The image also targets ignorance of Araimi 4 the violent effects of video games. Also, the fact that the mother is reading a newspaper while the father is on his computer is intended to establish the couple as rational people who stay current with events going on in the world. In the other image, a young American citizen is holding a banner and the message is with with an arrow pointing to his left leg where it says which also is saying the left (liberals) have knee-jerk reactions when it comes to violence (CDC 6). CDC has forcefully argued that bearing arms is not a major problem or cause for the increasing rates of violence. These two images highlight the personal characters that lead to violence. Also, it is the parents that have the greatest influence on the character. If the kids are not brought up well, then they are bound to be repulsive, rebellious and deviant. The first image captures this assertion very well. It shows the position parents take in influencing the behavior and the lack of attention they have towards violent video games. CDC sold their ideas very well. The company uses a wide range of captioned messages to communicate their ideas effectively. In most instances, the kids are using violent language. This violent language can easily be translated into violent behaviors if the mistakes are not corrected early enough. In the future, the company is going to attain its objectives. Through the use of such effective advertisement messages, a large population is going to understand the message the company is trying to sell and the goals. Eventually, CDC will manage to make people understand that it is not the guns that are violent but people themselves.
