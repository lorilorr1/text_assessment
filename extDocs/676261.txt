Roman Dominguez 1 Ana Adam Carter ENC 1102 23 February 2017 Should Prostitution be legal Prostitution has been a prominant problem for a long time ago. There are still two sides and Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women (GAATW) is the organization who defends human rights, being against making prostitution legal. Prostitution causes other problems such as Human Trafficking. That means that the person is being recruited, or obtained with the purpose of sexual actions without their consent by force. Most of the time it is a fraud where they play with the person telling them that they own something and the only way to give it back is by this performance. trafficking is the most popular form of exploitation for women with 70% of trafficked women being trafficked into the commercial sex trade (Human Trafficking Red Light District). The two pictures added at the end of this paper are advertisements that are against prostitution. GAATW goes further and defends the idea of making prostitution legal would increase this human trafficking. Ethos is the appeal of morality. In the second image on the right in the bottom as it says the government of Luxembourg which gives the audience the credibility. It is important to see that part of the picutre even knowing that it is a small portion on the right and it does not get your attention right away. Once the audience sees this part it makes them think that they should believe the message. Roman Dominguez 2 Pathos refers to emotions. Both images show prostitution as the concept of people the product saying that they promote human trafficking. In the first picture a woman appears inside of a withe box with transparent plastic on top where you normally can find steak or fish inside. On the bottom you can find the code, so that means that she is being sold like food, or a piece of meat . It is not only the fact that she appears in a container which can find food. It is also the fact that that food is shown to everbody. When you go to buy that steak you can see how red it looks, how tasty it seems. So it happens the same with this picture. You can judge her before you get her. You can see if you like the product because it is the way that she is being sold. Also her legs are crossed but she cannot cover herself because her arms are up which means that she is unprotected. Once you see that advertisement it makes you feel upset and angry, but at the same time vulnerable. Prostitution is represented as the sale of a body as an object. Poeple do not want to feel objectified. On the second picture the fact that there is a hand on the body make us think how miserable is the fact that you do not know the person who is getting that but they get all of your body. The woman is in white and the background is red. Red is used to capture attention. At the same time the hand seems big when compared with the body of the woman which probably tells us that she is pretty young. On the picture on the right, they are using light colors, different types of white for everything. On the other hand they are again using the red lips to create the constrast. Her mouth is almost in the middle of the picture making you focus your attention on that part when you first look the picture. Logos means logic. In the first picture you pay a prostitute, you are financing human Some people do not realize that paying a prostitute can actually have Roman Dominguez 3 these effects, and can be promoting that abuse. The information that appears written on the picture tells us the percentage of people who fall as victims of human trafficking and they say that 92% are used for sex and 98% of them are children and women which is pretty significant. For the second picture the sentence sex fuels human is talking about the same idea. Since the body of the women in the second picture is small it tells us that they are not only talking about human trafficking in general, they are also talking about children who are the most vulnerable. Kairos talks about timeliness. Prostitution has been there for a really long time but these pictures talk about something else. These images are giving us a clear message. They are basically asking for help, asking for action, asking for response. It is something that should stop. It is not because prostitution, it is because of human trafficking. It is a huge problem and the percentage is pretty significant. People should not be recruited, kidnapped or forced to do something that they do not want. The last picture with the woman with the red lips tells the audience that they are the ones who should react and avoid this situation. She cannot do anything, she does not have a voice in this. Her mouth is open but she cannot speak because there is something in the way. So the message is that you should do something and you should do it immediately. After analyzing these two images it is clear that both of them support Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women (GAATW) position about prostituion. Both of them reflect the idea of prostitution as promoting human trafficking as women being sold as an object. The paper discusses how the images portray ethos, pathos, logos and kairos and how much information one can obtain simply by observing pictures.
