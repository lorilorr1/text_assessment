Dubas 1 Kayla Dubas Instructor Missler Composition II 16 March 2017 No More Pain in New York New York is a state that is contemplating the legalization of physician-assisted suicide. In May of 2016, the bill to legalize physician-assisted suicide was proposed and is currently pending approval (New York). California, Oregon, Colorado, Vermont, and Washington, have already taken the initiative and legalized this form of treatment (How to access and use death with dignity laws). Compassion and Choices is an organization stationed in New York, whose goal is committed to promoting care and allowing patients various choices at the end of their life. This organization has two main slogans, life, My death, My and and Choice at the End of which are found on most visual rhetoric. Their mission statement is to work with people to keep them better informed in their healthcare, push the approval of policies that all people to have a say in their healthcare, and and implement medical aid in to mentally stable (Compassion and Choices). Compassion and Choices effectively uses ethos, pathos, and kairos to promote the legalization of physician-assisted suicide and raise awareness for this treatment. Compassion and Choices uses their slogans and rhetorical appeals to raise awareness in trying to convince people to support and legalize physician-assisted suicide. They use ethos to appeal to the ethical viewpoints, pathos to appeal to the emotions, and kairos to appeal to the timeliness. In one of their images they appeal to ethos by referring to Dubas 2 Brittany Maynard. This organization uses story, woman who lived in California, due to her being known as face of the death with dignity movement since she was diagnosed with brain (Schabner). She researched her options and knew she did not want to die slowly and painfully at a hospice center. The problem that she was faced with was having to move to Oregon to be allowed to use physician-assisted suicide. When it comes to ethics, people who view this ad feel a sense of sympathy towards Maynard due to the fact that a sick woman was forced to pick up her life and change her healthcare providers to be able to have a say. In addition, the images also apply to pathos, in the sense that they both leave the viewer feeling a sense of connection and relatability. One may not be able to relate exactly, but most people respect the ability to have a choice and say when it involves life. The image appeals to pathos by using first person. When one uses the viewer feels a sense of connection and makes it easy to relate. First person allows the viewer to be the experience of being the creators mind and allow for them to come up with their own message that appears to be being portrayed (Five Reasons to Write in the First-Person Point-of- View). It also gives the organization a sense of comfort and approachability. The viewer gets these feelings from using first person because it appears that the organization is not forcing one to agree with their views but merely wants them to listen and create their own opinions. Also, when they use Maynard, a real-life person, it allows for the viewer to feel a sense of compassion and pity for her because no person should have to go through the pain and suffering she had to. Lastly, the rhetorical appeal, Kairos, is shown in the way that it provides the viewer with a sense of timeliness. In the image, Kairos is being shown by using the word This refers to the time when most people would want to use this form of treatment. Considering the requirements needed to qualify for this treatment, one must have six months or less to live. Even Dubas 3 though one may never think that there is a time to die, the organization believes that giving someone who is in excruciating pain the opportunity to choose when they want to die is a remarkable thing. Physician-assisted suicide allows for the person to choose the place, people who surround them, and time they want to die. This was the privilege that Maynard was given once she met all of the requirements. Image one successfully displays the rhetorical appeals in trying to push the viewer to take a stand and work to legalize physician-assisted suicide in New York. Similar to image one, Compassion and Choices uses image two to spread awareness of physician-assisted suicide and push to legalize it in New York. When it comes to ethos, it appeals to it by using blue as their color choice. Blue is known for representing trust, responsibility, and faithfulness (Discover the story of English More than 600,000 words, over a thousand years). This appeals to the eye and gives the organization a more trusting feel. Also, the image uses the slogan and choice at the end of which appeals to the morals of allowing people the ability to control their own lives. Both images appeal to the ethics and establish trust between the organization and the viewer. This trust allows the viewer to feel confident in supporting and spreading the message Compassion and Choices is trying to convey. Also, image two appeals to pathos by making the word a lighter shade. It has all the writing in a dark blue but then they decided to have in light blue. This makes it stick out and draws the viewers eyes to it. Having a choice is important to people and is something that everyone can agree with or at least relate to in some way. Also, the color light blue has the meaning of and (Morton). When it comes to physician-assisted suicide, one may get the feeling of sadness due to it being one ending their life, but it is actually Dubas 4 a way one can escape from pain. Being given the opportunity to end pain, die peacefully, and on their own terms can be respected or at least understood by many. Lastly, the rhetorical appeal, Kairos, is being effectively portrayed in this image. Like image one, image two, uses the term of to reference the time one would turn to physician-assisted suicide. Image two successfully portrays the rhetorical appeals, ethos, pathos, and Kairos when expressing Compassion and Choices goal of pushing the ability for people to have control of their healthcare. The organization Compassion and Choices effectively uses the rhetorical appeals, ethos, pathos, and Kairos, to promote the legalization of physician-assisted suicide and raise awareness for this treatment. In both images, effectively get the organizations goal across which is to promote care and allow patients various choices at the end of their life. This organization works to use visual and real-life stories to help promote their cause and appeal to everyday people. Dubas 5 Work Cited Compassion &  Guide Star. N.p., n.d.
