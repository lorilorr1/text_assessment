Higgins 1 Amanda Higgins Professor Phillips Composition 2 9 March 2017 College Athletes Players Association The College Athletes Players Association (CAPA) is led by current and former college athletes, including former UCLA player Ramogi Huma, founder of the National College Players Association; former UMass basketball player Luke Bonner, and former Northwestern quarterback, Kain Colter. Their stand on the question: college athletes be compensated for their Is that they believe athletes should be paid for everything they do for the school. CAPA incorporates visual rhetoric in order to gain rights for college athletes. The College Athletes Players Association believes that every athlete at the collegiate level should be compensated for their work. They launched a group called National College Players Association (NCPA). Over 17,000 Division 1 athletes have joined, and they advocate for college rights. CAPA is fighting to extend scholarships for more than a year, fighting to have scholarships pay for their medical expenses and are fighting to give them a better food plan. Scholarships do not do enough for athletes. Some scholarships are very minimal on food. The rules of the National College Athletes Association and their scholarship prohibit them from accepting food. Ramogi Huma started this whole thing because he witnessed a teammate get suspended from the football team for accepting a bag of groceries (Who We Are). Therefore, they believe that they should be paid. Athletes should be given cash or checks. Something they can use for food or medical expenses. For the past couple of years, athletes have been going to court and arguing about unionizing. They argued that since they are employees of the school, Higgins 2 they have the right to unionize. On March 26th, 2014, the College Athletes Players Association won its case at the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), granting students the right to unionize. Unionization got CAPA rolling towards their end goal for college athletes. it does do, though, is set the wheels in motion of college athletes forming a union in the coming years. Should that happen, we would likely see drastic changes to the way college athletics work. Everything from increased value of scholarships, concussion reform, improved medical coverage for athletes, athletes being allowed to accept endorsements, and possibly athletes being paid as (Fornelli). College medical expenses should be paid for just like an employee of the schools medical expenses would be paid for. Image 1 shows that the Players Association is strongly with the athletes; image 2 shows Kain Colter, one of the spokesman for CAPA speaking at an event. In image 1, the first thing that catches your eye is in big, bold, blue letters inside a white box. Underneath it, also in the white box, is Athletes Players The second thing that pops out to you is the word also in big and bold, but this time with white letters. The word  is an appeal of Kairos. It shows urgency and boldness. Ethos is explained in this image by putting the website of CAPA down at the bottom to show its credibility. The entire background is a royal blue. color blue has positive effects on the mind and the body. As the color of the spirit, it invokes rest and can cause the body to produce chemicals that are calming and exude feelings of (Bourn). Royal blue in specific can represent superiority. also represents meanings of depth, trust, loyalty, sincerity, wisdom, confidence, stability, faith, heaven, and (Bourn). The only other color in the image was white. White is associated with protection which goes along with what Higgins 3 the players are doing for each other in the Association. Image 1 relates to the goal of CAPA by showing them loud and clear that they stand with them and for them. They are not just on the sidelines of this fight; they are in the fight. The image shows and means that the players in the Association are together, as a unit. They will stand with any other player willing to join and fight for their rights that they deserve. In image 2, you notice Kain Colter, one of the leading spokesman and head of the Association. He is a public figure for this group. This is just one of the many places he has spoken. This image shows that CAPA is not just all talk. members do go out and fight for rights. The goal of CAPA is to gain players the right to accept endorsement deals and to give players basic, human rights. In this image, he is speaking on behalf of the Northwestern athletes and their right to unionize. On the front of the podium, where the website of the Association is, it is in the red. Red is associated with strength, power, and determination. Everything the group is trying to radiate, the color red stands for it. It may also represent passion in some ways. Everybody in this group is passionate about gaining rights back and gaining new rights for college athletes. It again has the colors blue and white just like the first image. The second image also has logos appeal in it. Again by adding the website of CAPA up at the top of the podium and having two of the leading spokesman of CAPA there and in the picture shows how serious this group is. Also in the image, all the way to the left is Ramogi Huma, a former UCLA player. He is the one who first started the College Athletes Players Association. Image 2 is showing before the celebration of Huma after they found out they won the case and granted Northwestern players the right to unionize. They also said they are employees of the school. Higgins 4 College Athletes Players Association is getting closer to their goal of having athletes get compensated for all the revenue they bring to the school. Their hard work is left unnoticed by the school. They are not allowed to accept any gifts as a reward for doing well. Their medical expenses are not paid for, and they are limited to food. Coaches can decide to not renew their scholarships. Scholarships are the pinnacle reason to why some kids stay in college. If some athletes are not getting scholarships, they should at least be getting paid. The athletes are putting 50-60 hours a week into their sport and receive little recognition. Image 1 summarizes the power of the group. Their determination and strength can be seen in every color and every word. It is a powerful message in a little picture. Image 2 summarizes the credibility of the group. It has two of the leading spokesman/leaders speaking on the behalf. It was a big thing they were arguing over, and they won. It was a step closer to getting to their final goal. Athletes all over the country and in every Division, all have one goal. To play the sport, they love but also get equal rights and recognition.
