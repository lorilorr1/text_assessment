Dakota Broughton ENC 1102 Intermediate draft For this project I plan on creating a video about how all public schools should offer dance as an extracurricular option. Most schools offer sports, dance may be an art but it is also a sport. In the video, I plan on showing how kids enjoy dancing while at the same time explaining how dance can relieve stress. Stress which mainly comes from school which is why it is schools that should offer dance classes. Dance is one of the ways I relieve stress and has been since I was able to start dance when I was young. Most children have the funds to start up the dance career because on an average with competition and performances is about 200 dollars a month. The video will consist of no spoken words, the only thing that will be heard is the music. While the music is playing you will see words that explain the point along with videos of dance and other videos that go along with the point I am trying to get across. Work cited Patino, Erica.
