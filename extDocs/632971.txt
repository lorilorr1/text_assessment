West 1 Jillian West Prof. Gocinski ENC 1102-910 30 January 2017 Sexual Objectification of Women a woman is embodied, so is she (E. Kaschak, 1992). The media sexually objectifies women for the appeasement of a male audience. Women are continuously used in advertisements to sell many products such as Chanel, Budweiser and certain fast food restaurants. The way they are modeled is by their body parts, as objects, to sell to the public what the product provides. Companies like Collective Shout are against these types of marketers because they provide distorted perceptions of women and sex. Dolce & Gabbana designs aesthetic fashion appealed across the world, but their advertisements question their respect for women. Through a compromise of sacrifice and understanding these two will come to agreeance. Dolce & Gabbana, any form of discrimination and harassment must be prohibited, paying constant attention to creating and maintaining a safe, healthy and adequate working environment, in which all Employees and Co-workers are protected. These are the essential conditions which ensure for the participating in the pursuit of the corporate of Apart from their mission to create, design, produce and distribute high-end clothing, Dolce & Gabbana values everyone and prohibits discrimination. They provide an environment in which everyone is respected. In this article it describes fashion as an aesthetic; that fashion is structured by stylization, glamorous, and sexualization. Through research it is found that fashion across nation does not vary by much. With this in consideration, the way women are advertised across the world is similar and appreciated as remarkable art. argue West 2 that (cultural) sociologists should take aesthetics seriously, as aesthetics forms partly independent dimension that cannot be reduced to structural factors or field der Laan and Giselinde 2016). The aesthetics represented in fashion cannot be boxed into other ideas because they do not compare. analysis shows how visual elements in fashion images are part of a multi-dimensional aesthetic system in which meaning depends on the context in which elements occur and (van der Laan and Giselinde 2016). Researchers found that fashion images can represent a multitude of elements and that the true meaning depends on what element outshines the others and how it is interpreted. Dolce & Gabbana does not choose to objectify women through their fashion, only to express their remarkable aesthetic. The way their advertisements are interpreted shows that their voice on the topic of objectification is underrepresented. Collective Shout is an organization that shames and exposes corporations, advertisers, marketers and media engaging in practices which are offensive and harmful, especially to women and girls, and also to men and Collective Advertisements that reinforce dishonest ideas about girls, sexuality and relationships are the marketers Collective Shout actively exposes. This article discusses a White House Council Report on Women and Girls and how sexual assault has become prevalent on college campuses. It is assumed by feminist scholars that since the media sexually objectifies women it promotes the idea of sexual assault; that women and girls like being touched and looked at a certain way on the media so society accepts the same behavior in everyday life. study proposed that the more men are exposed to objectifying depictions, the more they will think of women as entities that exist for sexual gratification (specific sexual scripting), and that this dehumanized perspective on women may then be used to inform attitudes regarding sexual West 3 violence against (Wright and Tokunaga 2016). As men witness objectification of women they believe that the existence of women is for their gratification and that women are less than human so their act of sexual violence against them is valid. Collective Shout believes that with the acceptance of objectifying media, women and young girls suffer mistreatment. It can seem comical or a political tactic to others, but to women it harms their security. It teaches young girls that their competence, security and appreciation is dependent on how they look and their comparison to those women lusted after in the media. that is why perhaps the best form of resistance is, first of all, the simple awareness that the female body is a gazed-upon body and secondly, the unrelenting conviction and steadfast commitment to reject that condition. Only by turning into a as Braidotti (2011b) has advocated, and by harnessing that strength for the enterprise of empowerment, can society move ahead more steadily towards gender (Ponterotto 2016). In order for society to come to agreeance there has to be an acknowledgement of a body as a beautiful thing, and by using their differences as strength for a source of empowerment instead of decreasing their strength to a weakness used only for the appeasement of men. The commonality between both stakeholders is that they have respect for women and young girls. Dolce & merchandise serves to uplift the confidence of women, to inquire and idea of an elegant, beautiful, and competent woman. Collective Shout serves to respect women and their securities, to alienate the perception of women as sexual objects with no sufficient purpose and to prevent the practices of harmful and offensive acts against women and young girls. Dolce & Gabbana has to acknowledge that though their intentions in their advertisements is not to promote sexual violence or to offend any women, certain media they project does present dishonest perceptions of sex and women. This is not to disrespect their aesthetic fashion, but to West 4 propose an alternative that challenges their marketing to campaign against sexual violence and promote women individuality. In this instance, Dolce & Gabbana would be introducing all types of women in to their advertisements and acknowledge their differences. Collective Shout would comply by accepting that this process will take some time considering that Dolce & Gabbana have been in business for more than 30 years and a change in marketing takes time to compute. They would also help fund a predicted fashion show against sexual violence that models Dolce & Gabbana clothing. In summation, nobody sets out to objectify women. Advertisements in the media are subject to appease society but they fail to consider who might be offended. It causes other companies to form and combat against marketers. Dolce & Gabbana provides aesthetic designs and advertisements that are controversial to the eye but has no intentions to fragmentize a body. Collective Shout is concerned with how mainstream society has become distorted alike to porn and targets those who sexualize women. Through compromisation, Dolce & Gabbana would be more considerate of their advertising and market against sexual violence and promote women individuality while Collective Shout provides their time and help fund for Dolce & future events relating to sexual violence and harassment.
