Professor Roth Class: ENC 1101 Date: 1/29/17 Title: The legalization of marijuana Should marijuana be legalized for both medical and recreational purposes? Marijuana is the most frequently used illicit substance in the United States. A recent study shows that 24 million people in the United States use marijuana for medical purposes. With numerous laws that criminalize the use of marijuana, many people who are in desperate need of a way to relive their pain are not able to. This has been a main topic in countless mainstream social media sites, corporate news debates, and even presidential elections. The legalization of marijuana has benefits aside from it medical ramifications. Millions of dollars a year could be pumped into the U.S. economy from recreational sale and the taxes attached, as evidenced in Colorado. Therefore, legalizing marijuana would not only be beneficial for medical purposes but for economic purposes as well. One example of an economic boost after legalizing marijuana is in 2013 when one marijuana dispensary in Oakland collected $1.2 million in sales taxes the year after legalizing The legalization of marijuana would lead to less people going to jail for drug charges. This can be beneficial to the department of justice because they can focus more on people who use and sell hard drugs such as heroin and cocaine. With less people going to jail for drug charges the issue of overcrowding could potentially decrease. A main argument that could be used against the legalization of marijuana is that it leads to criminal behaviors among teens in the paper I will point out why this claim is false. For this paper, I will be exploring the benefits that come with legalizing marijuana. Bradford, H. (n.d.). 4/20: 16 Ways Marijuana Affects The Economy.

This article states many ways that legalizing marijuana will be able to help the government. It states that with legalizing marijuana recreationally the U.S. government would be able to make up to 13.7 billion in sales and with the tax revenue it would be more. The next argument that this article articulates is that with the legalizing of marijuana there would be job opportunities with localized businesses and government ran marijuana dispensaries. The article also shows the other ways that people see why selling marijuana would be frowned upon by many people. I believe that this article is reliable because it comes from the Huffington post. The Huffington post is a well know way to get reliable news articles. The article has a connection to my paper because I used on of these facts about the amount of money one dispensary could make in a span of one year after marijuana was legalized. This article is helpful for my paper because it helps me write about the reasons why marijuana should be legalized while also showing me why people think that it should not be legalized. With this I, can write my article discrediting some of the reasons that people want marijuana to be legalized. Magdalena, et al.

This article is an experimental report where it looked to see if people who lived in a state that recently legalized marijuana were abusing it. In the report, they did a convince sample where they asked the people in the legalized states to do a survey and answer some questions. They were asked three questions all referring to if the person taking the survey recently abused Professor Roth Class: ENC 1101 Date: 1/29/17 Title: The legalization of marijuana marijuana. In the results, they found that more people were abusing the drug when it was legalized, but the same amount of people who are abusing the drug while it is legalized was the same for states where it legalized. With the results, they concluded that people abuse the drug the same as if it were legalized. This article has good credibility because it came from google scholars where it must be a legitimate research and it must be graded by peers before it is allowed on to the website. This article will be able to help my research topic because it will show the skeptics that even if marijuana was legalized people would still abuse it if it was not legalized. With this I could talk about how marijuana is like alcohol. More people will be responsible while using it then there will be who abuse it. Green, K. M., Doherty, E. E., Stuart, E. A., & Ensminger, M. E. (2010). Does heavy adolescent marijuana use lead to criminal involvement in adulthood? Evidence from a multiwave longitudinal study of urban African Americans. Drug And Alcohol Dependence, 112(1-2), 117- 125. doi:10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2010.05.018 The article was conducted to test if the use of marijuana in teens leads to criminal behavior later in life. This article is good for my paper because the results show that there is no correlation of teens who smoke marijuana leading to criminal behaviors later in life. It does show that heavy users of marijuana in teenagers do show a trend of having performing criminal activities. This is not a problem because I can relate it back to abusing alcohol in teenagers. Teens who use alcohol responsibly and abuse it can still lead a good productive life, when the person becomes reliant on the substance is when there is a problem.

This helps my introduction because it highlights my point that medical marijuana will be able to help people.
