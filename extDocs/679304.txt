Akandh 1 Student Professor Gaspar ENC 1102 5 March 2017 Project 2 Intermediate Draft The thing that most people have in common is eating. So, how food is produced has a huge impact on their daily lives. Some food is produced with genetically modified organisms, also known as GMOs, and people prefer that but there are people that prefer that their food not be affected by GMOs, naturally produced. One company that favor or approve of GMOs is BASF, full name: Baden Aniline and Soda Factory, because they produce and manufacture products with GMOs. However, there is another company/organization, which is known as The Non-GMO Project, that disapproves of food affected by GMOs because they have concerns about human and environmental health and the effects GMOs have on farmers. The two companies have contrasting ideals, on either ends of the spectrum of the topic, with their goals not compatible and clash with each other. Even though they may not have the same mission, they share some common methods that can lead to a compromise and cause less of a rift between the two companies. As stated before, BASF favors the use of GMOs because it is one of the major companies that produces and manufactures products with and/or uses genetically modified organisms. BASF believes that using GMOs can improve and benefit lives around the world. While on the other hand, The Non-GMO Project opposes the use of GMOs, the opposite view of BASF. Their mission is to spread awareness of GMOs and provide products that are Akandh 2 GMOs-free and made naturally. They believe that GMOs cause health problems for humans and negatively impacts the environment where GMOs are used. Word Count: 267
