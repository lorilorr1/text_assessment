Washington 1 Karon Washington Karen Hanson Enc1102 1/27/17 Fracking Stakeholders Hydraulic Fracturing or is a process used by oil and gas companies to extract natural gas embedded in rock formations known as shale. The process consists of fracturing the underground rock with a pressurized liquid, that funnels the natural gas up the well and to the surface where it will be used as an energy source. The United States relies heavily on fossil fuels to operate everyday machinery, therefore stakeholders such as The Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) wants to expand the fracking industry across the nation. In contrast with the IPAA, is the Food and Water Watch (F&WW), an organization that dedicated to ceasing fracking projects due to its hazardous effects on groundwater. To integrate the stances of both organizations, fracking sites must be regulated by F&WW personnel and destruction to potable water sources must be reconditioned with oil and gas corporation funds. Hydraulic Fracturing is an expanding industry due to a high demand for natural gas. The demand for natural gas is expanding across the nation, and the fastest growing source of natural gas is shale gas. Shale gas is natural gas trapped inside of shale formations. Shale formations are sedimentary rock composed of clay, quartz, calcite, and other minerals. The shale formations are the source and the container of the natural gas, which is mostly 90% methane with traces of other hydrocarbons such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide and other gases (Gregory, Vidic, & Dzombak 2011). Washington 2 The IPAA is dedicated to ensuring that the economy has a secure supply of energy. The IPAA represents the thousands of crude oil and gas producers in the United States. On its website, the IPAA reported that producers develop 95 percent of domestic oil and gas wells, produce 54 percent of domestic oil and produce 85 percent of domestic natural (About IPAA). U.S independent producers and IPAA members have a critical role in strengthening the American economy and energy security. To maintain their prestige in the American economy, producers use various technologies for drilling oil and gas wells. In 2012, 59% of oil and gas wells drilled were used for hydraulic fracturing, 41% used horizontal drilling, and 12.9% used multipad wells Petroleum Association of The IPAA and its members are devoted to maintaining the American economy, energy supply and profiting from their investments. Their concerns are solely monetarily motivated, therefore the various technology that is used by the corporations are to increase profit. However, the IPAA states that their cutting edge technology and methods aim to reduce stress to the environment. For example, horizontal drilling through shale rock lessens the amount of drill sites, and increases the amount of gas collected. So even though the IPAA is focused on profits, there newly developed technology and methods reveals their concern for the environment. The F&WW organization is against all threats to communities and the environment. F&WW advocates healthy food and clean drinking water for everyone. The F&WW believes in a sustainable future, that ensures future generations have access to essential resources. Another aspect of a sustainable future is protecting the quality of the environment. Additionally, this organization has campaigned against corporations who deem profit over people. According to the website, they have accomplished many milestones in their fight against fracking such as Members of the European Parliament to vote in favor of an immediate Washington 3 moratorium on they also are the first organization to call a ban on fracking, and initiated the formation of Americans Against Fracking (Food and Water Watch). Anti-fracking organizations are concerned with fracking because of its contamination of ground water. In gas: Should fracking  it states that additives are toxic, carcinogenic or (Howarth). These chemicals have the capability to destroy communities if exposed to sources of water. Since the F&WW is devoted to protecting essential resources it perceives fracking as a threat to its mission. The only compromise with the F&WW can be obtained by reducing the risk of fracking fluids seeping into groundwater. To integrate the stances of both organizations, fracking sites must be regulated by F&WW personnel and destruction to any potable water sources must be reconditioned with Oil and Gas corporation funds. The F&WW regulates the fracking sites by ensuring that chemicals used in the fracking fluid is nontoxic and disposed of properly. Therefore, whenever a spill occurs the fluid is not toxic enough to harm any animals or humans. Also, the companies involved in the fracking sites must provide potable drinking water to all people whose drinking water contains traces of fracking fluids. According to The Environmental Costs and Benefits of Fracking, generates income and, done well, can reduce air pollution and even water use compared with other fossil fuels. However, done poorly it can release toxic chemicals into water and (Jackson). Therefore, essential that sites be managed by individuals who are concerned about the environmental aspects of fracking and not just the monetary gains. These personnel can ensure that corporations are following proper environment safety procedures at every drill site. Both stakeholders will be somewhat satisfied with this compromise because it allows the IPAA to continue their shale extractions, and it satisfies the Food & Water Watches concern over the environmental repercussions of fracking. In the case Washington 4 that a spill occurs, the companies involved will be fined for damages. For example, a fracking site in Louisiana caused the death of seventeen cattle and the responsible companies were fined $22,000 to resolve the issue (Rahm 2011). The process of hydraulic fracturing has major benefit and risks to the nation. Fracking brings jobs to communities, increases the energy supply and economy. Alternatively, it can contaminate groundwater and poison the surrounding land if handled incorrectly. potential as an energy asset and environmental hazard is the reason that are concerned about the issue. The do share common ground on the issue and that common ground focuses on protecting the environment. Both stakeholders recognize the effect fracking on groundwater, and have made efforts to improve the relationship between fracking fluids and ground water. The IPAA has developed more ecofriendly methods, while the F&WW has caused moratoriums of sites. A compromise between the stakeholders requires the groups to merge together for the benefit of the economy and environment.
