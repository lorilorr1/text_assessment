Casey Kendall ENC 1102 Project 3 Today, we are facing many issues with health care. On a day to day basis, families are struggling to figure out how they will get health insurance. With our newly elected president, individuals are waiting to see what will unfold for health care. In addition, many people have drawn their attention to health. As Trump took office, it followed with the march shortly after. Women today want to know how they are going to get health care and what is going to happen to the health care that is currently being provided. That is where planned parenthood comes into play, Planned Parenthood is an organization that is founded on providing health care to women who otherwise get these services. Planned Parenthood is free of charge and had aided many women with their services. Currently, planned parenthood is in risk of being shut down. If planned parenthood were to close, many women would no longer get the health care that they need. Planned Parenthood provided services such as, annual OB/GYN check-ups, birth control, STD test, and etc. If these services were to end, women would be out of health care. Many people think of planned parenthood and think abortion but, in fact, planned parenthood provides many other services. Planned parenthood provides individuals with information to conduct safe sex as well as providing contraceptives. Planned Parenthood not only servers as a place for health care but, they provide vast information on health. Planned Parenthood is a platform for health and is currently at risk of closing. Since, Planned Parenthood is free of charge for their patients, this service is government funding. Due to the fact that Planned Parenthood is government funded, at any time, they services can stop.
