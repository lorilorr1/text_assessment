Ajayi 1 Adedamola Ajayi T. J. Murray ENC 1102 26 th February 2017 Is using children as actors/actresses for advertisements acceptable? Imagine a four-year-old having to learn grammar way above their age range. Using children in advertisements has become a norm in todays society. Children during their young ages are singled out from their peers to learn large amounts of information about products or companies in order to advertise them. Companies usually do this because the adults who have the ability to purchase the product or use the services are easily lured by using children to show off or explain the products. This defeats the purpose of growing up the They are introduced to experiences that they should not yet be exposed to. Growing up is a process that has to be taken step by step and should not be rushed because it can affect the mind of a child.
