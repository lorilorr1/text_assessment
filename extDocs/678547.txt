Persaud 1 Student Richard Gaspar ENC 1101 3 March. 2017 The Debate Between Genetically mutated organisms have conquered the food industry for a long time now. Unfortunately, most people in society do not know where their food is coming from. Dr. Terry Shintani from the Hawaii Health foundation stated, GMO is the result of a laboratory process where genes are taken from one species and inserted into another in an attempt to obtain a desired trait or characteristic. GMOs are also known as genetically engineered-, bio-engineered-, biotech crops, or transgenic Have a Right to know in Our The debate about whether or not are in fact harmless has been tossed around throughout the years. The Non-GMO Project dedicated their entire organization to fighting This organizations mission is to, and protect the Non-GMO food supply, while educating the public about the harmful effects of (The Non-GMO Project) Another key stakeholder is Biofortified, which is in fact pro gmo unlike the first stakeholder. Their mission is to, public discussion of biotechnology and other issues in food and agriculture through science-based resources and (Bio fortified). Whether or not are harmful is the main concern for both The Non-GMO project and Biofortified. Although they each have their own opinions about educating their consumers is a concern they both share. Since both companies depend on their consumers, labeling would be helpful to each stakeholder because it will allow people to make an informed choice on what they want to purchase. Persaud 2 On one side, The Non- GMO project was founded in 2007 by two grocery store owners. Located in Berkeley California, The Natural Grocery Company rallied campaigns asking manufactures if their products contained GMOS. The Big Carrot Natural Food Market also took part in this event and later developed a policy that prevented to be purchased by their company. Both grocery stores collaborated together and created the Non-GMO project Non-GMO Sometime later, the project expanded and became open to all stakeholder groups. The organization states, Non-GMO Project remains the market leader for GMO avoidance and one of the fastest growing labels in the retail sector. We offer North most trusted third-party verification for non-GMO food and Non-GMO This organization also sells their brand and one can find their label in almost any supermarket. If were to be proven harmless this organization will lose a lot of money. However, according to Megan Norris, a Ph.D. candidate from Harvard University, independently reported toxic effects caused by One example is an anti-GMO advocacy group called the Institute for Responsible Technology (IRT), which reported that rats fed a diet containing a GMO potato had virtually every organ system adversely affected after just ten days of feeding Since the process of making is toxic, they claimed all were high risk for toxicity. If all products are labeled the Non-Gmo Project would lose their label in stores. However, the organization is sure to gain more money as well as keep their mission. The Non- GMO project should support labeling in stores because if they truly believe are dangerous they would want to have products labeled so consumers can know what they are really eating. Alternatively, Biofortified is located in Wisconsin and is a major producer of breeding crops using technology. They are pro- GMO. This mission is to, expert Persaud 3 scientific analyses to support the public good and the scientific community (Biofortified). This organization has a team of farmers and students working with them to help prove that GMOs are not harmful. Experts in science and science communication of biotechnology serve on our Board of Directors and help develop resources for Biofortified. (Biofortified) This organization believes that are not harmful and that they benefit society. When most people see the GMO label on items they immediately put it back. This is because there is a stigma surrounding So one might think that having labels may be a detrimental for the Biofortified group. However, this may not be the case because Biofortified genuinely believes that are not harmful. The main problem is that people are not educated on the topic. They want to get it out of the mind that are bad or harmful. According to Emily Forman, every food item we eat is a Meaning, it has been genetically modified to be bigger, juicier, heavier, more drought resistant, etc. From the beef we eat to the corn we eat, almost all food items have been from its natural state. (66) If were to be labeled it would benefit the Biofortified group because they would still be earning profit due to the high amount of people who rely on GMO products. The organization would also keep their mission intact like The Non-GMO Project. One element the Non-Gmo Project and Biofortified have in common is that they both want to educate the public on Even though they both have different views on this topic they both believe that people should have a choice on whether they want to consume it or not. That is why passing a law that requires food products to labeled if they use would benefit both stakeholders. Both organizations believe are standing there ground for what they believe in. the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has rejected labeling of GMO foods. By contrast, labeling is required in countries including the 27 member nations of the European Persaud 4 Union, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, Brazil and China. (FDA) American needs to consider joining this list soon because consumers should have the right to know what they eat. Consumers need truthful marketplaces in order to make informed decisions. Stakeholders like the Non-Gmo Project and Biofortified should invest time into making legislation provide consumers with product labeling. Overall, The Non-GMO Project and Biofortified have two completely different opinions on One believes that are in fact dangerous and should be kept off of shelves in the supermarket while the other believes there is no scientific evidence that proves are harmful and they actually benefit society. However, despite their differences, both stakeholders agree that educating the public is important so everyone can make their own informed decision on the consumption of GMOs. Consumers have the right to know what is in the products they are purchasing. It would benefit both stakeholders if were labeled. Not allowing the public to know what is in their food would be an injustice for both companies and would defiantly go against their main beliefs. If this problem is successfully addressed both companies can maintain their identities and keep their missions. (WC: 1202) Persaud 5 Works cited Biofortified. Frank N.
