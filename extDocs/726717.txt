1 P e e d Shawn Peed Sabah Firoz Uddin First Year Composition 4/20/17 Marijuana is a drug in the cannabinoid family of substances that is usually smoked or eaten. It is a plant based drug and is most times completely natural. The recreational use of marijuana has been considered a federal offense in America since the and although there is an increasing relaxation on the drug in a legal standpoint, there is still certain states that consider even the medical use of marijuana illegal. Another issue America faces today is the fact that the economy is struggling with no hope in sight according to William McDonald. The one way to help increase the income and to inflate the economy is to create a tax in a material that has the availability to be taxed such us marijuana. Recreational marijuana should be legalized for positive economic purposes. If recreational marijuana were to be legalized, it could be taxed when sold creating a new source of revenue for the United States government and it would also cut back the amount of federal spending used on prisons so that the United States can put that money elsewhere. From a legal stand point, recreational marijuana is only legal in nine states and medical marijuana usage is only legal in 23 states according to Mike Maciag. Medical marijuana has been considered for most states to be legal however some states still veto it from becoming 2 P e e d legal. Most states still have some sort of law against recreational marijuana usage and some even acknowledge it as a federal crime and enforce it such as states like Texas, North Carolina, or even South Carolina. The United States still consider marijuana a class 1 drug which makes it a summary offense. The drug has been gaining support since the legalization of recreational marijuana use in Colorado around 2012. Ever since than states like California and Nevada have followed in foots steps. Recreational marijuana has gained a lot of ground since the early where it even legal for its medical usage and had just started to become decriminalized. With alcohol and tobacco having the same, if not worse, effects as marijuana, America should legalize it then use alcohol and tobacco as a model on how to tax it. Medically, this would be a safer alternative than either alcohol or tobacco. Kevin Hill States how damaging alcohol and tobacco is by Talking about how threw out his medical experience, seen so many patients sick or injured due to alcohol and is thought to be cause of at least 100,000 deaths each year. (Hill, pg.XII) and the fact that tobacco is the biggest cause of death that can be prevented, causing more than 480,000 deaths every year. (Hill, pg.85). No were in Kevin Hills book, did he mention alcohol or tobacco having similar or comparable medical benefits as marijuana, however he states strongest evidence supporting the use of cannabinoids as a medication is for treating two other types of medical conditions. First is for use in treating pain: chronic pain, long-lasting pain that does not respond well to treatment, and neuropathic pain, pain from specific nerves that often leads to coldness or burning. Second, cannabinoids may 3 P e e d be useful in treating the muscle spasticity, or tightness, associated with multiple (Hill, pg.105) So seeing as marijuana has a greater purpose with the same if not less risk than alcohol or tobacco, marijuana has merit of becoming legal. When legalized, marijuana would be taxed just like alcohol or tobacco and generate a tremendous amount of profit for the United States. The United States economy, as put by William McDonald in his book The Decline and Fall of the U.S. Economy, is failing. Mr. McDonald talks all throughout his book about the horrid state of the United States economy. He even talks about the need for change in the economic system, saying that if America does not change something major in its economic plan there will be a terrible outcome like the loss of houses and the inability to compete with china (McDonald, pg.XXI). The way the United States could implement an economic change would be with legalizing and taxing recreational marijuana. If the United States used the tax for tobacco and alcohol as a model for recreational marijuana then billions could potentially be made in revenue. To calculate the potential revenue, the average tax on cigarettes is $1.00 per pack, and you use that tax per gram of marijuana. According to Jon Gettman, the average cost of marijuana in 2005 was $6.14/gr. Then according to Zachary Crockett, 13.7% of adults in America smoke marijuana which is over 28 million people. If the average used amount of marijuana is about a gram a day than the amount of money the United States would be getting threw taxes would be over $14 million a day. A current example of how marijuana has helped the state of the U.S. economy is Colorado. According to department of revenue, the taxes they use is 4 P e e d marijuana tax revenue includes the 2.9% retail and medical marijuana sales tax, 10% retail marijuana special sales tax, 15% marijuana excise tax, and retail/medical marijuana application and license fees. With all of fees and taxes for marijuana, they have made over $17 million from sales made in February. According to entrepreneur magazine, in the fiscal year of 2016- 2017, Colorado made a total of $198.5 million in tax revenue and spent it in the following way. $40 million went into BEST the Building Excellent Schools Today fund. More than $18 million went to the Department of Public Health and Environment. $7 million went to the Marijuana Education Campaign. $6.7 million went to substance abuse prevention grants. The Department of Agriculture received $3 million. The Attorney office received more than $1 million. The Department of Education received $8.4 million. About half of the money went to the Early Literacy Competitive Grant Program. The Office received $216,944(entrepreneur magazine). With all these figures, it is irrefutable that taxing recreational marijuana would make a great and positive impact on the United States economy. The amount of money marijuana could bring in threw legalizing it nationwide could be immense. The amount alcohol and tobacco bring in from taxes according to Joseph Rosenberg, is alcohol making $9.6 billion from taxes in 2015,and tobacco making $14.5 billion from taxes in the same year. So if America were to implement the same kind of tax that the United States put on tobacco or alcohol, or even use the same tax method as Colorado when it comes to recreational marijuana, imagine how much revenue would be made and how the United States could use that money. America could use that money from the new tax towards underfunded public services like schools and health care. The evidence is indisputable when it comes to taxing marijuana and being able to make a substantial income off of it. 5 P e e d Some might argue that marijuana is an addictive substance with health risks. One of these people who disapprove of recreational marijuana is Ashly Estoup and her book The Impact of Marijuana Legalization on Adolescent Use, Consequences, and Perceived Risk: Substance Use & Misuse who states legalization resulted in significantly higher rates of marijuana use, abuse, and pg.3). She also states its dangers by saying marijuana use can result in impaired cognition, damage to developing areas of the brain, depression, and suicidal ideation in (Estoup, pg.1). However marijuana is by no means the most addictive drug and nowhere near as addictive as legal alternatives. According to Kevin Hill research has shown that the percentage of users becoming addicted to nicotine, heroin, cocaine, and alcohol was 32 percent, 23 percent, 17 percent, and 15 percent, respectively. 14 At a rate of 9 percent (for adults), marijuana is less addictive than these (Hill, Pg.37). Hill also points out the fact that it is healthier than other legal options by stating use is the number one preventable cause of death in the United States, contributing to more than 480,000 deaths annually . . . The numbers for alcohol are considerable as well, with alcohol thought to contribute to at least 100,000 deaths each (Hill, Pg.85). Obviously any drug someone uses is going to have some sort of health risk yet marijuana is obviously much less lethal or addictive than alcohol or tobacco which are legal substances, they also serve a medical purpose rather than alcohol or tobacco. Not only will legalizing marijuana bring in money, but it will save it as well. A lot of our government funding is going towards prisons and it help that they are overcrowded. According to Christian Henrichson, prisons and prisoners cost the United States tax payers a lot of money, saying more than 1.2 million inmates (of 1.4 million total people 6 P e e d incarcerated in all 50 state prison systems), the total per-inmate cost averaged and Delaney, pg.11). So if according to McVay in his book Drug War Facts the amount of people incarcerated for marijuana related charges in 2015 was 643,121 people. If recreational marijuana were to be legalized in 2015 and the figures are correct by both Mr.Henrichson and Mr. McVay than the amount of money America could have saved from prison cost is somewhere around $20 billion dollars. That amount of money, just like the taxes, could be focused elsewhere like healthcare or schools. Instead of wardens, the U.S. could be funding teachers. With Recreational marijuana being illegal, it puts a burden on taxpayers due to the fact a lot of their money is going towards locking up people for using a mild drug. The legalization of recreational marijuana with taxation has been shown to have a potentially beneficial outcome for the United States. It would create a tremendous income from the tax for the United States like tax has been beneficial for its state. It would also lessen the amount America spends and the amount the tax payer spends on prisons due to the fact the United States has so many people imprisoned for marijuana related charges. All of this money that the United States is either saving or gaining, could go into underfunded government programs like schools or health care. The law on marijuana however can only be changed by lawmakers, not by the people. The best way you the best way you the reader could make this change is by talking to your local lawmakers and voting towards the legalization of recreational marijuana with taxation whenever you get the chance. 7 P e e d Bibliography 1.
