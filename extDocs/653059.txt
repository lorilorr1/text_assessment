Today, it can be said that, the United States has been hailed as a haven for immigrants. Historically, from 1860 to 1920, a total of nearly 30 million foreigners arrived in the United States. The amount of American immigrants has fluctuated over the course of the last century, due to political and economic circumstances. Every year hundreds of thousands of immigrants, legally or illegally, from around the world, come into the United States (Nadadur 1037). These immigrants come with different motives: for better labor market prospects (Cadena 910), unification of their families, better lifestyles and job opportunities. Other immigrants are refugees suffering from persecution, civil wars, natural disaster, and economic inequalities in their home country, in quest of freedom, better economic fortunes, protection, and benefits (West 427). Also, Approximately, 1,052,415 legal permanent residents came to America in 2007 (West 427). As a result, this vast immigration affected the U.S. economy, population, business, culture, politics, and many other aspects in both positive and negative ways. There are many reports and research papers available which show how the economy of the United States has been impacted by immigration. Some of the existing studies argue that the economy of the U.S. is affected negatively by immigration whereas, others argue in opposition of it, as they say immigration positively affects the pace of innovation in the U.S. economy (Hanson 25). Therefore, this paper will look to the question whether immigration has negatively or positively affected the economy of the U.S. Source Cadena, Brian C. Competition And Low-Skilled Immigration Journal of Human Resources , vol. 48, no. 4, 2013, pp. 910-944. In the article Native Competition And Low-Skilled Immigration which is divided in five parts, author Brian C. Cadena investigates how geographic differences in expected earnings within the U.S. influence newly arriving low-skilled immigrants decisions to locate. He starts his paper by giving a overview about the topic and discussing two primary challenges regarding the topic of his paper. In the second part, he talks about the welfare reform and native labor supply. Also, he explains the graphs of 1) Female employment rates from 1979 to 2003 and ages 18-54, and 2) Low-Skilled female employment rate by pre reform welfare participation. In the third part of the paper, he discusses about the expected earnings, location choice and various formulas about the same. At last, he gives various types of data and results in respect to prove his main argument. However, this article shows the different reasons for immigrants to inflows to the U.S. therefore, it is related to the topic at hand.

Costs And Benefits Of Science Quarterly (Academy of Political Science) , vol. 126, no. 3, 2011, pp. 427-443. In the article Costs and Benefits of author Darrell West argues that the benefits of immigration are much broader than popularly imagined, and the costs are more confined. In the article, the author first gives a brief history of immigration, which gives a rough idea of how many immigrants come to the U.S. and from which country. Secondly, he states the different ways and reasons why immigrants choose to come to the U.S. In addition, the author explains how the cost of immigration is lower than the benefits immigration bring to the United States. For instance, this benefits includes the use of government services, tax payments, wage levels and social security contributions by immigrants. Then he shows how skilled immigrants are a big part of the rise of high-tech and bio-tech industries. Lastly, he mentions how the computation of economic and intellectual contributions are challenging, and as a result, social costs and benefits are harder to measure. Therefore, this article is relevant to this topic because the author provides information about the history and different reasons for which immigrants come to the country.
