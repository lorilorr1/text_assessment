Barr 1 Mary Barr Bob Botkin ENC 1102 20 April 2017 Project 3 Intermediate Draft Selective attention is the psychology term that defines why humans only pay attention to select things in their environment that they deem important Is Selective This phenomenon is evidence to why people only place mental disorders on their radar when it affects them directly or someone close to them. Yet the unbearable truth is, 43.8 million American citizens are diagnosed with a mental disorders; meaning 1 out of 5 people a person comes across may possess a mental disorder Health By to the This catastrophic statistics should alarm the American population to realize mental illness is not a rare disease, confined to the typical stereotype, it has no type, can affect people of every races, genders, economic status, and sexuality. The significant problem in the world of mental health, is the police officers lack of education on mental disorders. Ill detection of common signs of mental disorders has constructed a bridge between police officers and suspects with a mental disorder. This lack of communication on the issue has resulted in prison system housing majority of the mentally ill in America. percent of Americans in jail and fifteen percent of Americans in prison are diagnosed with having a mental illness; leaving 356,000 mentally ill people in the legal system Barr 2 (Swanson). The police job description is to always protect and serve his/her community, but a situation involving a person with a mental illness can not be handled and deescalated with the same tactics that are commonly taught in the academy. More often than not, a person with a mental illness is arrested not for a suspected crime, but because they have been labeled as a danger, and threat to people around them or they appear to be hostile and incomprehensible. The officers deficient knowledge on mental disorders will blind him in identifying that the person may have a mental illness and this is causing them to be unaware of their actions, scared or unable to process what is going on appropriately. The jail system in most situations will cause a symptoms to become worse because the individuals are not receiving the treatment and are denied services they need to help control their symptoms. The leading step in rectifying the outlandish number of those with a mental illness in jail and prison is to include mental health as a part of the academy and to create laws/standards on how to proceed with situations involving the mentally ill. Mental Health America reports there are 200 forms of mental illness documented by psychologist and doctors. The most common disorders presented in America are depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, autism, and personality disorders. Depression is diagnosed when a person presents little interest in things they once enjoyed, depleted energy, hopelessness and has these signs for more than six weeks. Anxiety disorders are when the feeling of fear, worry,and anxiety become so overwhelm, the day to day activities are interrupted, anxiety disorders usually lead to panic attacks (Grohol, John). Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, Barr 3 also known as ADHD, is classified when a child has little interest, can not stay focus for long period of time, seems to be wandering off in their mind constantly and must be doing something with their hands to keep them still (Grohol, John). Post traumatic stress disorder is commonly seen in soldiers, those who were raped and those who have witnessed an insane crime. Symptoms of the disease are constant flashbacks of the experience, avoiding any memory of the event, drastic change in routine and an increase of anger, fear and anxiety if they experience something that reminds them of the traumatic event. People who have bipolar disorder or called manic depression, are mostly identified by their irritable behavior, extensive mood changes and manic episodes. Schizophrenia is commonly noticed because the person experiences hallucinations and delusions, and are unable to tell difference between them and (Grohol, John). Autism is a disorder that has a wide spectrum of disorders under umbrella; people with a disease on the autism spectrum, usually have a difficult time communicate, do not look people in the eyes often, do not comprehend on the same pace as their peers, problems with sensor (touch), show a need for strict routine and do not recognize signals presented in body language (Grohol, John). is the persistent decline in a memory and difficulty in making new memories. Personality disorders is one disorder that shows little trace in the adolescent years and is only diagnosed in majority cases until the person is in their twenties (Grohol, John). Like autism, personality disorders is a type of spectrum that has different types on it, including antisocial personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder. Among the disorders previously stated, people with bipolar, post-traumatic stress and personality disorder are the most likely out of all the disorders to have a run in with the cops that leads them to jail About Mental Illness and Barr 4 The brain is one of the most complex entity discovered and researched on Earth, and still poses many questions with unfilled answers. Although the brain is an intricate piece of matter, there are a couple of things that can affect its normal functions, producing the presence of a mental disorder. Mental disorders can be commenced by biology, psychological trauma, environmental stressors and genetics. When it comes to the human body, imbalances or abnormalities can be detrimental to the body functioning correctly. When blood cells are not the right size, such as sickled, muscles can not receive the correct amount of oxygen and will not perform precise; this small detail in the biology can skew functions dramatically. Like the blood cells, if there is an abnormal balance of neurotransmitters in the brain Causes Mental imbalance of chemicals in the body like epinephrine, serotonin and dopamine, or injury to the head, the brain will not perform at its expected intensity, resulting in a mental disorder. A little bit too much or a little less of something when we are cooking seems harmless and often times goes unnoticed, but when it comes to the human body, the risk of these imbalances can be destructive. Although people try to stay on top of their bodies and go to the doctor for physical, chemical imbalances can often go undetected, until the effects of the imbalance start to show. Corresponding to genetics plays a big factor in mental disorders. When humans are conceived, they are passed down some of their parents traits through genes; this includes genetic markers that make them more susceptible to certain diseases. Bipolar disorder, depression, schizophrenia, autism and are all common forms of mental disorders that can be closely caused by genetics. Scientist have proven that if a person suffers from bipolar disorder ninety percent of the time they have a family member that deals Barr 5 with depression, a higher number than children who have a twenty percent chance of experiencing depression, if their mother had it When a Parent Has a Mental Illness: HEREDITY & MENTAL Environmental stressors include any sudden change in a life affects them deeply, such as a death in the family, school, moving homes or anything major happening on the social scale. The most prevalent example of this is seen in the adolescent population. A suburban father, Pete Earley, in his book describes the toll it took on him watching what he called son just being a college kid and sprawling out of actually turn into his son being arrested and diagnosed with bipolar disorder. This biography documents son story with his bipolar disorder, but mirrors the story of countless orders. School, especially finals time, can take a toll on students, and the mixture of not eating right and the amount of stress can bring on a mental illness, commonly depression and bipolar disorder. The last causation of a mental disorder is a traumatic event. Traumatic events are things that classify as physical, secual or emotional abuse or any event that can cause an extreme amount of fear and distress on a person. The most popular disorder to be diagnosed for a person who has been through a trauma is post-traumatic stress disorder. Mental illness does not only affect a certain demographic of Americans. The prevalence of mental disorders in America are sitting at very high numbers. The main thing to learn from information on mental disorders is that it may not affect a person currently but the odds that it could are high. The biology of our body, genetics, environmental stressors and traumatic events are all things that can not be completely controlled by a person, yet these are the known factors Barr 6 of mental disorders. The idea that someone is more likely to be jailed, over something they can not control, puts a lot of humans and human rights at jeopardy.
