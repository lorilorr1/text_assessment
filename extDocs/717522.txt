Olivia Powdar ENC 1102.906 Prof. TJ Murray April 11, 2017 I Ask These Questions We need to change the question we ask when interviewing athletes any time we have the chance to ask them questions. On ESPN the reporters are supposed to ask questions that are going to give us real answers. Some of the reporters that are asking the questions, are not asking the best questions. They are asking questions where the questions are easily answered by a yes or a no and nobody watching the game wants to hear a yes or no answer they want to know what the athlete is really thinking. The first thing that needs to be done is the prep work for the questions needs to be looked over by at least 2 of their peers to see if they are able to answer the questions in more than a yes or no answer. The questions need to be rehearsed several times before they ask the athletes or the coaches the interviewer want to be tripping over their questions when they are asking the questions. The questions need to be thought provoking so the interviewer is able to get a good answer.
