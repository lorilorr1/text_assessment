Brown !1 Sasha Brown March 1, 2017 ENC 1102-70 Project 2 PETA In todays day and age, society has started to grow an awareness of what we do and how it affects each other. Growing concerns for global temperatures have lead millions to reevaluate what they can do to halt the destruction of our eco-system before it is too late, a leading organization in this process is PETA. PETA which stands for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals is a long standing proponent not only of animal interests but also of global, environmental, and even civil interests. Their mission first and foremost is to end animal suffering and by ending animal suffering, ending the social and environmental issues that coincide, such as climate change (PETA,1). Climate change is directly related to the production and consumption of meat, so it in interest to use this shared fate of the Earth as leverage ant motivation for people to end the large meat industry. proposal of saving the planet from the dangers of climate change is promote veganism and all of the issues it can help combat. PETA is open and even controversial in their methods of effecting change, so it is not surprising that even in their ads they are pushing the envelope to get their message heard. Through shock value and humor PETA works to inform the public of the damage the meat industry does to our Earth; using a controversial approach PETA hopes to turn the public onto a vegan diet. Using Brown !2 rhetorical strategies, we can analyze how two specific advertisements speak to many different audiences to promote an Earth-friendly diet. Picture one is an advertisement for PETA promoting a vegan lifestyle to and noting on the incredibly detrimental impact the meat and dairy industry has on our water usage in the U.S. This image is a great example of the path PETA generally uses in their marketing and advertising that truly plays up their ability to incorporate rhetorical appeals. First and foremost, picture one uses ethos to add credibility; they have their organizations name boldly displayed so that anyone who catches glimpse has a verified source of this eye catching advertisement. Next s the use of celebrity to add gravitas and credibility, this single image has Pamela Anderson as the model and David Lachapelle as the photographer. These particular people add credibility to the campaign because Pamela not only has widely known celebrity but she is a well known dedicated vegan. Anyone who was to see the image would know that there was no hypocrisy in their choice of model as she prescribes to the exact lifestyle the image is promoting. Second, using David Lachapelle who is renowned in the art world and is known for conveying fine art film and photography that carries a social message. One of these aspects alone would add ethos, but the combination of all three gives it a firm foundation of credibility. When you have well known people willing to put their names and faces to a campaign it is reassuring to the public. Peta, a sometimes radical organization, prides itself on openness and honestly sticking to what they believe is right, and featuring celebrities who navigate all sides of Hollywood works to create accountability and merit. Picture one also displays an incredible amount of pathos; even from first glance it offers interest and shock value by featuring a surprised looking woman completely nude in the shower. Brown !3 This something that will automatically grab peoples attention and even make viewers feel uneasy. The use of nudity is what will draw the audience in and hopefully get them to take another look at the content of the image. The contrasting colors of the neutral black and white juxtaposed with the edgier and attention grabbing red text brings your eyes to do a full scan of the image once more; this time perhaps noting that all of the most important messages of the image are in the red ink. Another feature that adds ethos is the varying styles of text in this image,there four different stylings of font that add or detract to the intensity of the photo depending on the context of the words. The last thing picture one offers in terms of rhetoric is the use of logos; once viewers get beyond the fact that this can be perceived as a choice of campaigning, they will be able to see that this is a campaign backed with fact and data. While in a shower with very little water and a surprised look on face, we read that meat and dairy production uses over half of the water supply in the U.S. and a way to save water is veganism. This statement balances out problem with solution as well as shock value with fact. The information on the image brings together how meat, water, and environment intertwine, which is the true point of the entire campaign. The second image gives us a different take on the problem of climate change and the things that affect climate change completely. This image relies heavily on pathos to evoke feelings of lightheartedness and humor, this image offers feelings of comfort and modern aesthetic. This image is simplistic, it has a clear cut focus and offer information in big colorful letters; this campaign uses soft pastels and crafty fonts to convey a caring, gentle, but humorous message . According to research in color psychology, pastels are used to curate a calming effect, Brown !4 pastels offer earth tones with a bit more liveliness with ties in perfectly with a campaign highlighting climate change (Ciotti, 1). The light lavender, green,and yellow work to create an image feels welcoming, creative, peaceful, and healthy. This image also uses humor and a quirky cuteness to appeal to the audience; it uses a drawing of a falafel to say that saving the rainforest and therefore the earth is as easy as eating falafel. In addition to pathos, the second image offers logos with a quick facts about how the past 40 years, a third of the South American rain forests have been destroyed to feed livestock for the meat this gives us a powerful fact and then leaves the experience of the image up to us by offering a question of to save the I believe that posing a question gives the power to the audience to lead them to think about the image in depth and without it feeling like they are being aggressively shamed into doing what the image is trying to influence. This campaign offers a low pressure solution, to a usually heavy hearted problem. It carries out its message in such a casual way that even the hard facts will appeal to peoples pathos as well as logos. These images do a convincing job of balancing the actual message with how the message makes the audience feel. They take a subject that has been beaten to death and address it in a way that feels neither redundant or forceful. This will support efforts because it gives veganism and environmentalism a refreshing and modern perspective that will appeal to a wide range of audiences, from sex appeal to humor to artsy images, these campaigns paint the choice to make the effects of climate change a simple and fun decision. It nudges people to choose an earth friendly diet without the berating and shaming that has so often come with the message of environmental veganism.
