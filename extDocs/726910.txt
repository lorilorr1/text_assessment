Xiong 1 Xin Xiong ENC 1102 4/30/2017 Smoke and Haze in China In the modern world, the struggle between taking care of the environment by avoiding pollution and economic development continues unabated. This is more apparent in one of the fastest growing economies on earth, the Republic of China. While many acknowledge that it has a smoke and haze issue, many also acknowledge that the country needs the industries so as to provide employment to its billions of people and work towards securing the first world status that the country and its citizens crave. The fight between environmental protection and economic development in China is a main problem in China now. In my opinion, I believe we should flight for our environment, trying our best to stop smog and haze, no matter what we need to pay. Although some people may say that a industry is really important which decide the international position of this country. However, there is only one earth that we have, we cannot lose it. If we are all suffering from smog and haze one day, what we will do with our industry? Nobody will care it. Therefore, we should pay attention to smog and haze and take action to protect our environment. Greenpeace provides more information relate to smog and haze and we can find a lot of useful information relate to how to solve this problem. There is only one planet, and as such, the misuse of the planet by environmentally degrading it is not only wrong but also not viable for the long-term survival of human beings (Greenpeace East Asia). Chinese government should do all, it can so as to reduce pollution which is endemic in parts of China (Greenpeace East Asia). China is one of the most polluted Xiong 2 countries on the planet and as such, it ought to find ways to control the endemic air pollution not only for itself and its citizens but because it also affects the rest of the world (Greenpeace East Asia). People need to recognize that pollution in China is a dangerous trend and one that ought to be restricted for the sustainable success of the state. One has to note that in a situation such as where some cities have such a high level of smog and smoke that it causes illnesses in the very workers. As such, the workers end up spending significant amounts of the income they make in the search for the medication that on pollution-induced diseases that come from the very industries while some may even die (Levine). As such, it would be prudent for people to acknowledge that it is in the interests of the workers whom they strive to protect to have less polluted, less smoky and less smoggy skies over cities in China. In order to reduce smog and haze in China, people could joint civic education, through the media and other means, of the people in China to adopt the industries that do not pollute the environment leading to haze and smoke the type that the country is experiencing. The civic education in stakeholder forums in the media would ensure that all the parties in the country have information on the need to conserve the environment which is possible as the government has now allowed reporting on air pollution (Wong). In this case, people can work to demonstrate to the factory owners that it is in their best interests to control the pollution they emit in their factories in both the short and the long-term (Wong). The forums could be on issues as diverse as alternative energy rather than oil and coal which produces the smoke and others. People also need to convince the government to ensure that there is less air pollution in the country through the application of policies that encourage cleaner manufacturing. Chinese leaders have been on record as noting that the air pollution in the country leads to a poor image of the country among the international community (Wong). From this perspective, it seems that Xiong 3 the government would be willing to act on initiatives that ensure that there is less smog in its cities (Greenpeace East Asia. The Solutions to Air Pollution in China). Some of the proposals they could provide for the government include requesting the government to subsidize the cleaner energy for the industries and homes, such as wind power while imposing a carbon tax on the energy sources that are likely to pollute the air such as coal. The subsidies would ensure that businesses do not suffer for the adoption of cleaner energy, and continue to be competitive in the international market. If two organizations at the opposite ends of the spectrum on the economic growth versus environmental pollution issue were to approach the government on this matter, it is possible that the government would be willing to listen and act on the issue. Lastly, government could support small family or community owned industries that would assist in the reduction of pollution. While Greenpeace could lobby the government to close down the heavy pollutants, this could result in huge unemployment that would lead to a lot of resentment of the policy and the organizations (Levine). Instead, their support of the smaller enterprises would assist in the reduction of environmental pollution (Levine). The smaller businesses, which would consume less energy and less human resources, would produce fewer pollutants. Moreover, these modest industries would assist in the employment sphere by keeping large numbers of people self-employed and even employing others (ACFIC). Moreover, with the knowledge on pollution that would come with such, the companies would be enlightened on the need to make voluntary donations to Greenpeace that will keep its fight for environmental protection all over the world going. In conclusion, even though a industries and economic grown is important, but we could not sacrifice our environment for it. People should engage in joint civic education so as to sensitize the industries on the need for cleaner energy. Secondly, the government to encourage Xiong 4 policies that would lead to cleaner manufacturing such as incentivizing cleaner energy prospects while taxing the coal. Lastly, the government also assist in the formation of smaller industries that are likely to use more energy and human resource-efficient policies leading to less pollution.
