Bunyon 1 Robert Bunyon Instructor Basil ENC 1102 26 February 2017 The Funding of Planned Parenthood The relatively recent issue concerning planned parenthood and whether funding should be allocated to these facilities is a great topic of controversy today. There are essentially two sides to the conflict, one side, such as the American Life League, believes that planned parenthood facilities are ultimately evil and should be banned from providing certain services such as abortion and providing contraceptives to the people. On the other side of the spectrum, NARAL America believes that funds should be supplied to these clinics and that what planned parenthood stands for and the services they provide are just and necessary in society. Since these two outlooks on the topic are polar opposites, there is very little room for compromise. This causes each side of the issue to try and get the support of the people behind them, and try to actively fight off attacks from the other side. The NARAL website home page uses advertisements in the form of pictures to try and persuade people to join the fight and to educate them on the laws in the United States. Two specific advertisements were used on home web site that used the rhetorical appeals ethos, logos, and pathos very effectively in order to evoke interest from ones who visited the page. The rhetorical appeals were used in order to get the onlooker involved, or at least create a lasting impact on them. In world, there is much controversy concerning issues like immigration, gun control, and the environment, which are debated on a daily basis. Any time you watch the news Bunyon 2 channel there is a good chance you will also hear about the highly debated topic of abortion and planned parenthood. Planned parenthood provides many services to women who seek help with reproductive care and access to contraceptives. Lately, these institutions have come under fire from the conservative politicians and lawmakers, and especially from the recently elected president, Donald Trump. According to certain accounts, Donald Trump wants to ban abortion completely with the exception of cases involving rape, incest, and when the life is in danger (NARAL). Since Trump, a republican, is now president, this is the best chance for republican lawmakers to push through a bill that will cut the funding of federal tax dollars to planned parenthood facilities (Republicans). The main issue that people have with Planned Parenthood facilities is because of the fact that they are the prime performers of abortions. The fact of the matter is that planned parenthood facilities provide many more services than just abortions, but the main reason that lawmakers want to defund these facilities is because of abortions. Since these attacks have begun, young supporters of the movement have been coming out of the woodworks, attempting to help and fend off these attacks like never before, gaining around 1.5 million supports in just a year or two (Laguens). To begin with, the first image uses the rhetorical appeal pathos to effectively hook the audience at a glance. It strategically places a woman and a small girl at the forefront of the photo who are both holding signs, hoping to make a difference in something they believe in. In the background of the photo is a large crowd of protesters who are fighting for the same thing that the two women on the front were protesting. These qualities of the advertisement show that the cause is just and that it is a cause worth fighting for, seeing as a great amount of people are willing to go out and protest. Emotionally, when seeing the group of women protesting, one Bunyon 3 would feel sympathy for them and if they believe in the casue they may even look for ways to help. The image also uses words to generate a feeling of curiosity by stating the question of do we A sign stands out in the background that says giving the impression that whatever is opposing them may cause a divide among the people of our country. Moving onto the second image, it also uses appeals to pathos using words and color to create an effective advertisement. Beginning with the written words, the photo contains the statement a single U.S. state guarantees full access to This may or may not shock the reader, depending on their views on the topic. The organization wants this statement to shock people and pose interest on the topic because once you were to click on the image on the website, it redirects you to a page explaining each stance on abortion rights. Next to the words is a map of the United States. This map has every state colored in either red or shades of blue, signifying each outlook on abortion. States colored in red are explained as states that are and ones in blue are leaned more toward accessible abortion rights. The states with different shades of blue is represented as states who allow for limited access to abortions. These facts create a slight sense of anger almost, especially when concerning women because one of the largest arguments against banning abortions is the body my statement which is hard to combat at times. Using the color red to depict states that have restricted abortion access makes them almost seem like the bad guys, and the blue is seen as the good guys. The next appeal that is prominent in both of these pictures is logos, the appeal to logic. Each of these pictures have an appeal to logos, such as the curiosity created by the question in the first image. This creation of curiosity may cause the audience to search for ways to resist the political attacks, and also attempt to learn why this debate is so widespread and important. The Bunyon 4 second image shows the map of the U.S. and gives the statement which calls out to the reader to see what the readers own states laws and regulations are on the topic of abortion. The logical appeals inform the viewer on how strict abortion regulations are, and ways that they can resist and show support for the cause. Lastly, the two other appeals, ethos and kairos are used, but only slightly in the two images. The first image shows an appeal to ethos by the NARAL logo in the bottom left corner, and the crowd of people protesting for the cause shows that it is a credible movement backed by many activists. The logo shows where the image was created and for what purpose. Both of the images are displayed on the homepage of the NARAL, which is associated with the credibility also. The appeal to timeliness, kairos, is not obviously used in either of the images, but with some analysis of them, they each serve almost as a call to action, hinting that things are not progressing enough and that they need all the support that they can get. In each of the images, rhetorical appeals are used in order to get the viewer to develop an interest in and hopefully act on the issue that is presented, which is planned parenthood and the rights of abortion. The rhetorical appeal pathos is the main appeal used in both of the photos, by trying to attempt to stir up the emotions of the people. The other rhetorical appeal used effectively is the appeal to logos, by giving the facts of the laws and regulations of the United States in the second image, and the appeal of curiosity in the first. The other two appeals are not very prominent in either image, but they can easily be spotted while analyzing each of the photos. Using these rhetorical appeals is an effective way of involving many people with only a single glance. Bunyon 5 Work Cited Laguens, Dawn.
