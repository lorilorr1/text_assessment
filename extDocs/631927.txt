Harding 1 Kaamera Harding Instructor: Brenden Jackson ENC 1101 1/29/2017 The effects of captivity on the natural behaviors of wild animals In recent years, there has been increased concern on the issues regarding the welfare of animals. From the revival of the veganism movement to the continued fight against animal testing; animal safety and welfare has become a hot topic in pop culture today. However, one issue that has been debated on throughout the years, is the subject of animals in captivity. On one side of the spectrum people feel that wild animals should be in their natural habitat and not confined to cages in institutions such as Zoos for the rest of their life. On the other end, people feel that Zoos are vital to the rehabilitation of animals. When this issue started to rear its head, the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) was created to hold Zoos accountable for the care of their animals by requiring them to develop enrichment programs to simulate the natural environment of animals that cannot be released back into the wild. Although there are many polices in place to ensure the safety of animals in captivity I decided to look at animals in captivity and the effects it has on their behavior; socially and biologically. Salas, Marina, et al. Behavior and Hair Cortisol Levels in Captive Dorcas Gazelles (Gazella Dorcas) as Animal-Based Welfare Zoo Biology, vol. 35, no. 6, 2016, pp. doi:10.1002/zoo.21323. Harding 2 In this experiment, research created to focus on the effects captivity had on the stress levels in groups of Gazella Dorcas; a species of antelope. This was tested by taking hair samples of each individual in the group and testing it for levels of Cortisol, which is a steroid hormone linked to chronic stress. They observed the frequency of negative and positive interactions of the antelopes in the four groups. The results showed that a lack of space within the zoo provoked increased negative behaviors in groups of all males, which in turn raised stress levels (Salas, et al.) This research article was a collaborative effort done by a group of professors and post graduate students at The Autonomous University of Barcelona in Spain.

Mcphee, M Elsbeth. in Captivity Increases Behavioral Variance: Considerations for Captive Breeding and Reintroduction Biological Conservation, vol. 115, no. 1, 2004, pp. doi:10.1016/s0006-3207(03)00095-8. This research was focused on the long-term effect that captivity has on a whole species. One concern was that captive animals lose a range of behaviors as a result of a predictable and unchanging (Mcphee 2004). Mcphee made two predictions on how behavior will change: there will be a direct change in predatorial response behaviors and there will be a high variation of behavioral traits between generations. The individuals used in this study were collected from three groups of mice from the Ocala National Forest from 1952-2000: one group is 35 generations since being removed from the wild, another 14 generations and the other 2 generations removed (Mcphee 2004).

She has a long list of publications that relate to evolutionary and conservation biology, behavioral ecology and behavioral responses to environments specifically captive versus wild comparisons (uwosh.edu Elsbeth McPhee: Curriculum Altman, Joanne D., et al. and Behavioral Effects of Gorge and Fast Feeding in Captive Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science, vol. 8, no. 1, June 2005, pp. doi: This Research was focused how captive animals develop behaviors and conditions that are not common in their natural habitat (Altman 2005). The common problem of lion in captivity is that they are prone to inactivity, obesity, stereotypy which is constant reputation of an action without a purpose (Altman 2005). The results of this study were that changing the feeding strategy to one similar to one they would encounter in the wild proved to show increased activity and less agnostic behaviors (Altman 2005). Joanne D. Altman is the director of Undergraduate Research and Creative Works at High Point University. She holds a Doctorate in Psychology from Temple University and a Post- Doctoral degree from John Hopkins University. Kohari, Daisuke, et al. Restriction Effects on Activity Motivation of a Captive Lion (Panthera Leo Journal of Veterinary Behavior: Clinical Applications and Research, vol. 17, 2017, pp. doi:10.1016/j.jveb.2016.11.002. Harding 4 In this experiment the researchers were studying how confinement effects the locomotive behaviors of zoo animals. The subjects for this study were 4 Indian lions; one uncastrated male and 3 females. (Kohari 2017). They had two captive conditions; the first was confinement in a bed chamber all day and the other was a released condition, with access to the exhibition. They found that the lions movements were different each day and involved abnormal pacing and restlessness.

His research interest includes animal welfare and behavior, emotional responses in animals. He also holds a PhD in Agriculture from Tohoko University. Brummer, Stacey P., et al. Effect of Enclosure Type on the Behavior and Heart Rate of Captive Applied Animal Behaviour Science, vol. 125, no. 3-4, 2010, pp. doi:10.1016/j.applanim.2010.04.012. The focus of this study is the effect the size of an enclosure has on the heart rate of a captive coyote (Brummer 2010). They found that in the larger enclosures, the coyotes exhibited similar behaviors and heart rate as their wild counterparts (Brummer 2010). The coyotes in the smaller enclosures demonstrated significant amounts of stereotypic behaviors (Brummer 2010). Stacy P. Brummer is a researcher that works at the USDA animal and plant health inspection service. She works alongside two other researches; Eric M. Gese and John A. Shivik, who both have a PhD in Wildlife biology.
