Dhvani Patel Comp 2 01-29-17 Should Marital rape be punished as severally as rape. We live in the 21 st century, where change is prevalent and progressive. The change is also one of the leading correlative factors to questioning the validity and the norm of certain issues. One issue would be, whether or not martial rape should be punished as severally as rape. It seems like a proposed question common sense but in reality there serves to be stakeholders that justify it equally. Marital rape is an issue that has been going for ages, also an issue that has been prevalent in areas all around the world. The debate answer seems so very obvious, but there a proposed statement that allow for us to understand the different perspectives. Understanding the stakeholder view in the perception of the law would serve to say that, marital rape should not be classified as rape but more so as a domestic violence charge. (Howard, Warner, Renzulli, print. 505-531). This serves to show that there is a consensus on the fact that the act is wrong but the debate lies within the charges. This itself proposes questions, why is it okay to justify rape if it involves major, the crime is still the same, the magnitude is the same but why does the term marriage hold to propose a difference consequence. The common ground though is the fact that rape is wrong, it matter what form or shape it takes. It is wrong and not justified no matter the reasoning may serve or under what it is occurring under. The stakeholder of the victim serves to show that no matter what the context is, the pain, hurt and struggle both arise in a similar stance. Marriage, does not make it valid to have forceful intercourse. It until recently that the UN classified marriage rape as a human rights violation. (Isidewith.com, web.) It is not justifiable to hold claims that it occurs because one says no, it would be false to hold that to be true. It would be valid to claim that it held from violence and abuse. Keeping that in mind, it be justified to treat the case far more strictly then the other the forms of rape. Because at that point, it is not only rape but it is also the incorporation of an abusive relationship. This would propose 2 different charges with 2 different sentences, it is very unusual to have a case of marital rape alone, but very much so possible. It until the 19 th century that marital rape was considered wrong. It was due to the movement in the 19 th century that brought about this change. The issue knowing whether this is right or wrong, the issue is understanding the severity of it. A study done in 2001, a survey was given to multiple students to assess the severity of a situation. The least severe situation was marital rape. So even considering the law based order, there still serves to change the conversation. (The Canadian journal of women and law, Kirkland.) The stakeholder upon the other side, who can be said to either be a lawyer or the accused would serve to propose the question of who decides what rape is and if there enough evidence to treat the case as extensive it to be called rape. It sounds absurd but in the eyes of the law, these questions are proposed. The stakeholder also serves to bring upon the statement that, in the terms of religion this as much of a heinous crime as rape. It is a propositional statement but this is taken into account for an argument. Those who believe that martial rape be punished as severally claim that marriage cause for such an account to be taken that extensively, and because it is marriage, it should charge as abuse. Taking account of both of the charges, having a rape charge is far more impactful and straining then a charge with abuse. And due to the holy bond of such an accusation be as severe. The irony is that; the stakeholders do have common ground on the fact that it is wrong but they fail to agree upon how extensive the charges should be upon a person. Another valid point brought up would be looking upon the, use of this case. According to some lawyers, the definition of marriage was where the case truly lies upon. The variation in meaning serves to hold another flaw within itself. Marriage does not give man the power to have sex with his wife whenever he chooses or pleases. But the social contrast of marital rape not only here but in other country, serves to say that marriage is the willing given to a man to have autonomy over a body. (Thenewsminute.com). Another valid point brought forth in one of the sources is the fact that proving rape is always based upon circumstantial evidence, (CEO of International Foundation for Crime Prevention and Victim Care. Gettu. Web.) Also, it is hard to prove marital rape due to the fact that a DNA sample would be taken, and then off that basis we would have to prove that the intercourse was not consensual. (Thenewsminute.com) The proof would need more substantial evidence, so even when proven we would have to take into account the past history. The whole issue of this debate is very confusing because no matter what the proof is, the case can be taken in either form. The proof can either serve to show whether the case is just abuse but both abuse and rape, or just an accusation. Due to taking this issue as one more prevalent in 3 rd world countries like, India where there Is no law for marital rape, such occurrences are considered the Both stakeholders can be said to hold their stance in place, but to an extent, the stakeholder for punishing marital rape just as abuse would be the conditional statements of those who have a lower literacy level. There are other 3 rd world areas that even acknowledge this even though the UN states it is a human rights violation, and due to areas with such social stigma, things like this often go unreported. The stakeholders of the accused also serve to argue that, marriage is a direct implication of consent. They also serve to hold the theory that, rape occurs due to the the theory that, men want to retain traditionally held power in society to protect themselves and their (sciencedirect.com, web, pg 332, Martin et al s 20017 theory). Another theory to serve this stakeholder correct would be that, would pursue such actions due to an anticuckoldry meaning to say that such occurrences occur due to causes that were there long before such an incident took place. Conclusively, both stakeholders do have a statements that can be used to debate the topic. They both propose a valid point in the eyes of the law, we take into account the validity in terms of social construct because if the case, we would be biased towards the debate. SO keeping all these factors in mind, one can ask if marital rape should be punished as severally as rape itself is a justified question, and a valid comprise one can hold is treating the marital rape equally to rape. Both occurrences do serve a similar psychological, and sociological questions hence using the same sentence is valid. (A.T.
