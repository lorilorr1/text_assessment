Nguyen 1 Alan Nguyen Emil Smith Composition 1 4 March 2017 The Progression of Medical Marijuana The progression of medical marijuana has been very profound in terms of the legal and scientific community. The use of medical marijuana is not new and it has been documented as early as 2900 BC by the Chinese Emperor Fu His. The health benefits however, have been very controversial even up to the twenty first century. The progression of medical marijuana for seizure treatment has been changing very rapidly in the United States. The perspective for the early was marijuana is a drug that can cause harm or can be used as a gateway drug, a term for a drug that can lead to the user using harder, more addictive drugs in the future. This negative viewpoint was supported by the federal government and the legal community, but as scientific research into using medical marijuana as medicine grew to prominence, the viewpoint shifted. By 2010 and onwards, the federal government and legal community has grown more lenient in the use of medical marijuana due to the increased research into the benefits of using medical marijuana to treat illnesses such as seizures. The view of medical marijuana has changed greatly from the early to the late due to the increase knowledge of the medical benefits of using medical marijuana. Before any real research was conducted on medical marijuana treating seizures, the federal government believed medical marijuana had no benefits and was merely a drug (Chapkis). With such primitive knowledge, legislators did not pass any legalization due to the limited knowledge of medical marijuana. Due to the many unknowns, many states even banned Nguyen 2 medical marijuana due to (Chapkis). As a result, the idea of using medical marijuana to treat illnesses such as seizures was very controversial so law makers did not pass any laws approving the use of medical marijuana, but instead passed laws to ban the drug for use recreationally and medically. Advocates tried to fight, but to no avail. As time passed towards the mid the view of medical marijuana took a huge one eighty. The sudden shift in the US about the public accepting marijuana inspired many scientists to conduct research on the benefits of medical marijuana (Titus). The results of researching medical marijuana and how it can treat seizures ranged from having serious side effects to aiding seizures in many patients (Titus). The majority however, showed there was a benefit in using medical marijuana to treat seizures. As more research and results were published, the mind set towards medical marijuana took a huge turn and by the mid resulting in many state legislators in California to approve the use of medical marijuana and pass laws allowing the drug to be used medically, with Washington and Oregon following shortly (Titus). By 2016, over twenty states have legalized medical marijuana, thus paving way the way for medical marijuana to be widely accepted. As more information about the effects of medical marijuana and the potential benefits became well known, the mindset of medical marijuana being a gateway drug and harmful shifted towards a wider acceptance of the drug to treat illnesses such as seizures. Although some state governments have accepted the potential benefits of medical marijuana, the federal government so keen on the idea. The beginning of the was very clear to the federal government. Nobody use marijuana, recreationally or medically. The drug is not to be used and is deemed illegal. There have been strict attitudes about marijuana for many decades, that has effected the governments approach to drug policy (Ferraiolo). The federal government viewed the drug as very dangerous and a huge component in crime, thus Nguyen 3 deeming the drug illegal throughout the United States (Ferraiolo). As time passed however, the publics opinion of medical marijuana has caused state legislators to legalize medical marijuana. However, the federal government still deems medical marijuana illegal in the United States (Ferraiolo). Even by 2017, the federal government is still skeptical of the benefits of medical marijuana even though there have been countless research experiments conducted on the drug and the mass legalization of the drug for medical purposes in almost half of the states. The increasing number of legal cardholders for medical marijuana is rising daily, with the federal government having no countermeasures due to the sparse resources in each state to combat the (Keefe). Times are changing and proof is that many states are legalizing medical marijuana. only a matter of time until the federal government recognizes that medical marijuana can have medical benefits especially for seizures and start to properly research and evaluate the drug for legal use.
