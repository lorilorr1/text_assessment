Student Quichocho Dr. Jenifer Paquette ENC 1101 3 February 2017 1 Annotated Bibliography Despite constant efforts at reformation in the American educational system, the United States continues to trail behind many other countries in overall academic success. Governmental acts such as former president George No Child Left Behind and former president Barack Every Student Succeeds place great emphasis on standardized tests in an attempt to measure academic success, yet the United States continues to rank poorly globally. Results for the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) show the United States continuing to fall in ranks in math, reading, and science. With this failure to adequately compete among other nations, the methodology in American education is questioned. By analyzing the United education system in light of other higher-ranking countries, one can identify differences and propose possible alternative methods in different aspects of the education system. Although there has been much debate as to whether the United States should or should not adopt other schooling tactics, one thing is certain: an educational reform in America is much needed. Resolving the issue of poor academic performance in the global community starts with the issue of standardized testing, followed by integrating methodology used in higher ranking countries into the United schools. How can abandoning standardized tests as the primary focus in schools benefit the American educational system? Student Quichocho Dr. Jenifer Paquette ENC 1101 3 February 2017 2 Bell, Julie Davis.
