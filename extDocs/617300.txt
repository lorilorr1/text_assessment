1 Project 1 Intermediate Draft As a creature designed to devour the disembowel remains of anything with a vertebra, one would think it strange that the giant panda consumes large amounts of bamboo, similar to that of an herbivore. Bamboo offers little in nutrients when compared to alterative meat sources, which there any, forcing the panda to rely on the preservation of its photosynthesis prey in order to prevent starvation. This translates to the giant panda consuming ample amounts of bamboo to maintain a healthy weight. Well, one may ask, why do panda then eat bamboo? That, although giant pandas depend on bamboo for the sake of its own survival, a change in diet to a more reliable victim for nourishment may insure the increases to a stable population, but, of course, not that simple. To better understand the role that giant pandas play in their ecosystem means to adopt the perspective that environmentalist and stakeholders that care for both the animal and the environment. The World Wildlife Fund, one such an organization that seeks the protection and preservation of animals and their habitats, have dedicated their time and effort for the conservation of endangered species like the giant panda. The organization themselves claim that the diet makes them vulnerable to the destruction of their habitat, but does good in that it spreads bamboo seeds, restoring and cultivating vegetation that is the home of many endangered species p.1). Unfortunately, with a growing industrial country such as China, deforestation is to expected, along with the destruction of ecosystems. Even versatile bamboo safe from the process, creating risks that the panda cannot compensate for. The blame would account onto the companies that endanger the creature by destroying its most precious resource, not the accustoms of the species dining choices. Therefore, in this case, the pandas 2 themselves need to change but the methods from companies that lead bamboo forests to become barren, decreasing the odds of survival for the animal. In response to the risk associated with the extinction of the panda species as a whole, China has initiated some plans of action to ensure that such a prediction come into fruition. One demonstration is how Chinese government increased its commitment to giant panda habitat protection, and has established 21 nature reserves (Wang et al, Despite this effort, pandas are very needy creatures, as they migrate and have difficulties managing natural disturbances to their environment. As such, this method of resolve would surely demand a price that is astronomical, and it still help in supplying them with any natural supplements that could very well be connected to many other factors as to why pandas as a whole struggle to flourish in efforts of procreation. Biologists and Zoologists, through experimentation and observation have looked into the bizarre behavior of a vegetarian carnivore and the harms that come along with it. One would assume that no drastic harm would come to pandas for eating bamboo as they have signs of adaptation to suit their needs for bamboo, but their carnivoran alimentary very low digestive efficiency (Mel et al, And though it attribute to physiological harm, evidence such as this make it evident that pandas and bamboo are incompatible with one another. Which has molded the animal to sluggish state that is bounded by the very bamboo that sustains its life. As once what could very well have been a capable hunter, resorts to sit sitting in one place and eating bamboo for most of its awoken hours. Now that be so bad if the very bamboo they love to chew on disturbed the nutritional intake of important vitamins and elements expected in a meat cuisine. During the transition from winter to spring, pandas juggle their diet from one bamboo type to 3 another, or transition from bamboo leaves to bamboo shoots. For the consequences of such a sudden change in available provision disturbs the chemical balance of nutritional intake, increasing mortality rate of the black and white bear (Nie et al, p.29). Even in their natural environment, complications outside of foreign influences arise, with the adversary in this case being the sustainability of a lack-luster eating program. Alas, as the effects burrow deeper than that. A crucial element, calcium, during the food juggling and mating season, becomes scares in a system, which in turn, hinders the development of panda embryos (Sekar, p.1). This suggests that bamboo is directly involved in the prevention of offspring among pandas, which can also be linked to why newly born pandas size appears abnormally small when compared to other bear babies. Evidently, a mother eating habits answer to the demands that a growing bear needs. Hence the argument that pandas should have more suitable resources at their disposal, so that reproduction can become more reliable and the chances for survival increase. With these two stakeholders in the discussion, they necessarily meet eye-to-eyes when it comes to if bamboo is overall good or bad for in the case. On one side, the reliance on bamboo is imbedded deeply, making the sudden change to a predatorily creature would bear no fruit. A sporadic introduction of an inadequate hunt would only bring harm to the balance of ecosystem, and a distortion of this harmony could mean more than the death of one endangered species. On the other hand, though conservation has replenished the species from a state of endangerment to a state of vulnerability, that mean pandas can live with ease in nature. Moving them to captivity solve the issue as they are one of the most expensive animals to keep in enclosures. Though they can receive the needed nutrients in a preserve, they 4 will either become too reliant on accessible food to survive in nature or return to previous patterns once returning to a bamboo enclosed forest. A compromise would have to be something along the lines of genetic manipulation and the introduction of a better fit biome for a carnivorous panda. With the study of the genetic coding of a giant panda to find the reason for a sudden dietary switch from carnivore to herbivore, biologist speculate that pseudogenization of its umami receptor gene T1R1 is coincident with such bamboo dietary the dopamine metabolic system is probably not that competent in the giant panda (Jin et al, What this entails is that the genetic encoding of the panda and a stimulation of dopamine can link to some of the causes for why the panda contradicts normal expectations of a creature with a similar structure. And so, the theory stands that if the panda eats bamboo by inherited genetics, then the alteration of the sequence to create a dominate trait that can transform the panda to a proper predator is feasible. Of course that as of now, it plausible with modern technology to change the behavioral patterns of a creature to a desired expectation of that level. Plus, the panda would need to find a new reliable resource to adequately satisfy its need for survival and growth without interfering with the nature flow of the food change to a great magnitude. However, such a suggestion will become obsolete if the giant pandas thrive in population or if they fade from existence leaving only dust and bones. In any case, such a method of opportunity for a while yet. But, if such a discovery were to happen, then each stakeholder will have to make the appropriate sacrifices to make the process work: organizations similar to the WWF and environments will have to be willing to transmute the iconic, pacifist panda bear to more bloodthirsty incarnation, and biologist will have to painstakingly observe and study the new creature and the possible damage it can do the species. 5 The extinction of animals, especially cute one like the panda, invite a feeling of jubilance. Both stakeholders want to say farewell to such a marvel of nature. The conversation devolves to whether pandas need to change to way they eat for their own wellbeing or panda are fine as they are now and it is people who need to change for the better. Either way, the efforts made in supporting pandas in their time of need has shown progress. With the numbers rising in head counts, things appear to be looking up for the fuzz balls. Showing both the harm and the chivalry of human intervention. 6 Works Cited Nie, Yonggang, Zejun Zhang, David Raubenheimer, James J.
