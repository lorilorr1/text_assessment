Kyle McGorty ENC 1011 03/5/17 Project 2 ADHD drugs, or prescription stimulants, are a big issue in society, but they are no new issue, they have been a problem since at least the start of the millennium. Although they have always been an issue, the commonness and severity of abuse has gone in up in recent years. Prescription stimulants are usually prescribed to children and adults with ADD or ADHD in an effort to help them focus and manage their hyperactivity. The problem comes when people without ADD or ADHD use the drugs to gain an unfair advantage in an academic or work climate. The side effects of these drugs include loss of appetite, loss of sleep, and increased heart rate as well as blood pressure. Not only are these drugs unhealthy for the not prescribed, they are also extremely illegal to sell and use when not prescribed. Adderall and Ritalin are schedule II drugs. M. Day writes an article discussing that the number of people, specifically between the ages on of 13 and 19, abusing ADHD drugs was going up. This study was done between the years of 1998 and 2005. The drugs that Day focuses on are Adderall and Ritalin, also known as amphetamine and methylphendidate. This article was published in 2009. It helps give a time aspect to the ADHD issue. Kmietowicz claims that ADHD drugs turn children into robots. Uniformed people claim that drugs taken for ADHD such as Adderall and Ritalin turn kids into robot and rob them of their individuality. Kmietowicz counters this with studies that claim different. Mill writes about the fact that prescription stimulants are commonly abuse on college campuses around the nation. Although only 1 out of 10 people claim to abuse, 50% of people claim to know dealers of these prescription stimulants. This articles that mills write was published in 2006. This again shows that the prescription stimulant problem has been going on for a while. The last article on the topic of ADHD drugs is written by Arria. This article is direct results from a scientific study. Other authors confirmed that the ADHD drugs problem is present in their articles, but this study shows whether or not prescription stimulant abuse works to improve academic performance. The results show that they do not help. References: 1. Arria, A. M., Caldeira, K. M., Vincent, K. B., K. E., Cimini, M. D., Geisner, I. M., & ... Larimer, M. E. (2017).
