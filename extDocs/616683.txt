All the butterflies have different colors and designs on their wings, their main colors are blue, green, yellow and red. These colors are mixed together to create the beautiful colors that you see on the butterflies today. The best kinds of designs from them are the ones that can change color on the fabric that they are printed on. Roman Butterfly is a fashion company that only designs with butterflies that can change color when they flap their wings. The Vanessa cardui also known as The Painted Lady, are used on the more mature fashions because of their brown and gold designs. The Monarch Butterflies are used in patterns for little children because of their more playful colors. The butterflies are the new fashion because they are able to be multidimensional since the butterflies can move, very lightweight so the clients weighed down by the cloth and worn by all celebrities who believe they are somebody. Just last week Jessica Homer wore a Painted lady gown to the where she won 5 for her new movie. Works Cited Vanessa  . Wikimedia Foundation, n.d. Web. 29 Jan. 2017.  . Wikimedia Foundation, n.d.
