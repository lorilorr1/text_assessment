Student 1 Student Dr. Richard Gaspar ENC 1102 712 5 March 2017 Hybridization of Solar and Wind Energy When driving through the hills of southern Illinois, the landscape draws in any visitors is may receive. This terrain is the perfect setting for wind farming, the wide landscape making it possible for each turbine to reach its full potential, and develop as much energy as possible. Although most of the United States is available to use more wind turbines, many renewable energy consumers argue that solar energy is a more reliable and economically pleasing option (SEIA Solar Energy Industries Association). Wind energy has been rising as a natural competitor of the solar industry, having developed as many as a third of the jobs created in the solar industry, and has decreased costs by about 90% since the (Wind Energy Foundation). The success of these two renewable energy sources have to come with constant battle, since both organizations would greatly develop with compromise. Wind turbines are capable of having solar panels on both the blades and the tower, which would continue creating energy in times of low winds, and vice versa. By having wind energy organizations and solar energy organizations collaborate, a multi-purpose wind and solar turbine can be made, allowing for the most efficient collection of energy. The Wind Energy Foundation is currently working to become a more accessible and reliable energy source across America, while educating the general public about how wind energy can become more reliable. Wind energy is one of the most cost effective forms of energy, maturing over the decades through better manufacturing and continuous engineering for a better Student 2 turbine design (Wind Energy Foundation). The design of each turbine is cost specific, guaranteeing more reliability than unpredictable fossil fuel rates, and allowing everyday consumers to trust in wind energy. The American Wind Energy Association vouches for these economic benefits applying to every consumer. Two of the four main pillars of the Wind Energy Agenda are to create a demand for more wind energy and make wind energy cost competitive to other resources, which grants the Wind Energy Foundation a large frame of support due to the similarities in economic wellness for the community (American Wind Energy Association). By showing the importance in sustaining the consumers through a renewable resource, wind energy is inclined to be viewed as a major resource for accumulating energy for the United States. Despite the influx of support for wind energy, solar energy remains the number one source of renewable energy within the United States, surpassing the amount of energy supplied by wind turbines by more than one thousand (gigawatts compared to megawatts) (Wind Energy Foundation and Solar Energy Industries Association). The Solar Energy Industries Association works with member companies to defend and the use of clean energy though the radiation, while educating the public of the uses of reliable energy. In terms of economic benefits, solar energy will show more progress than wind energy at every level, paralleling the amount of funds given to each group. Solar Energy has given jobs to over 200,000 workers within the industry, has declined in installation prices over the last decade by more than 50%, and growth of product has spread to major corporations in recent years, such as Walmart and Target (Solar Energy Industries Association). On a smaller scale, the Florida Solar energy industries association advocates for the same principles, and has connected community members to reliable groups working towards installation and promotion of solar energy (Florida Solar Energy Industries Association). The workforce of these two partner organizations establish the Student 3 influential force that solar energy has within each economy, raising solar credibility for being the main resource of renewable and reliable energy. Though these two resources have areas where they are especially abundant, they have areas where they will parish. In environments close to the northern and southern poles, sunlight is either very limited or non-existent for about one fourth of the year, which would make using solar energy impossible for sustainability reasons. More locally, rainier cities like Seattle who do not receive a great capacity of sunlight for the amount of industry in the area will not be able to use solar energy as a primary resource. For wind energy, the turbines are not practical for placement in very urban areas, nor are they practical in dry environments with no movement of air. Both of these resources have their faults, lessening their chance to be superior, but what would incline consumers to view them at the top of this theoretical list of renewable energy sources? The greatest source of compromise between solar energy and wind energy is to not eliminate any aspect, but to combine these two resources together to optimize energy production. By placing the solar panels on either the blades or the tower, the panels will be high enough, and at every angle to absorb as much light as possible, while the wind turbine continues to operate. Placement of the panels is primarily dependent on the ability of the panels to transmit light energy from the spinning blades, into another area of the wind turbine, but this can all be bypassed if the panels are only on the tower. With this, they will be still high enough above any trees or crop fields, and can successful transmit two types of renewable energy. This model is supported by the ideas of the United States Department of Energy on model hybrid systems already in place. Although the solar and wind systems are separate, they both are modeled to follow the same concept that systems are more likely to produce Student 4 power when you need (ENERGY.GOV). The different levels of wind and solar energy throughout the year will provide enough energy to constantly power the home without any worry. Additional, these type of hybrid systems are stand-alone systems, supporting that they are more powerful than individual systems (with either wind or solar). Accompanying these are an engine generator, and a power bank system that will ensure power can run for one to three days, increasing its reliability (ENERGY.GOV). By resembling current models, the idea of having solar panels on a wind turbine is made more reliable and practical for current engineering standards. Further indicating the reliability of having two methods of renewable energy is by using a novel energy prediction model (Cammarano et. al. 75-83). The model shows that both wind and solar energy production peak at around the same time, yet the solar energy production continues throughout the afternoon, while the wind turbine produces more energy during the night. Statistical validation of the differing times that wind and solar energy are produced shows that a collaboration to this degree will be highly effective and give off a lot of energy output. Although collaboration between two energy sources was never their primary objective, combining the strengths of both wind and solar energy will allow for a more efficient energy source that can combat the reliability of fossil fuels. The adaptability to different climates throughout the year will ensure a continuous flow of energy production, while never hindering the other source. Through engineering, a wind turbine with solar panels throughout will be able to create more energy than any current model of wind or solar, making it a reliable compromise of power within each industry.
