They have to acknowledge that they are both in a situation where the only way to find gender equality is to fight together instead of against each other.

While the HeForShe campaign strives to fight for inequality and injustices against women, the National Coalition for Men (NCFM) is a group dedicated to remove harmful gender based stereotypes, especially the ones that impact boys, men, their families and those who love them ).

The primary objective of NCFM is to promote awareness of how gender-based expectations limit men legally, socially and psychologically. The way that the campaign tries to accomplish its goals is by promoting discussion and study of relevant issues, disseminating data, and facilitating the growth of new resources ). One of the main issues that NCFM are fighting against are custody rights in a situation of divorce. By this, they mean that fathers have historically been denied equal parenting rights for many years. The 19th Century doctrine, which explicitly gave custody over children ages 13 and younger, was later replaced with the interests of the doctrine, but the gender bias  ). According to them, in the U.S., fathers usually ask for 50% custody while mothers ask for, and get, 80% custody during a divorce. This is more often called gender byproduct which is the result of having separate roles assigned to the two sexes. Fathers then become visitors and must also pay child support amounts with little involvement in their life ). The NCFM believe that taking a child from their father is wrong because a child must have a father just like he has a mother not only for the physiological development of the child, but also as a crucial part of the child development ).

Violence not only has adverse outcomes for females but also their relatives, community, and even their country. UN Women believe that violence is a crucial and important issue to address when talking about gender equality. They are currently working towards helping foreign governments in implementing programs to protect women against violence and have also been spreading awareness of violence against women Our ). While both parties are concerned with different issues, NCFM fights for the equal parenting rights and UN Women strive to stop violence against women, both parties fail to realize that these issues partake of a bigger issue which is gender byproduct. When analyzed, both parties are fighting for equality where both genders are free. Ultimately, the only way that they can both achieve true gender equality is if they decide to fight together, not against each other. They both differ certain points, but if they both acknowledge that both sexes have been deprived of certain rights that both genders should have, they will understand that they are fighting toward the same goal and hopefully, it will be clear to them that they are not each enemy.
