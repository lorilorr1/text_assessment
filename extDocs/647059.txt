Shackleford 1 Schea Shackleford Dr. K. Hanson ENC1102. Section 17 12 February 2017 Larger Tanks, Happier Whales The controversy that fuels the fire between SeaWorld Entertainment and SeaWorld of Hurt is the history of how the orca whales have been treated in the past and the effects that they have caused on themselves and on humans. This brings across the question: is SeaWorld a park for fun learning about the orca whales and how they interact with the world or is it a park for inhumane treatment and captivity? The dispute between SeaWorld Entertainment and SeaWorld of Hurt is becoming a serious problem however, where there is a will there is a way and there have been compromises on having a larger and more efficient home for the whales. SeaWorld Entertainment is an aquatic theme park and entertainment company delivering personal, interactive and educational experiences that blend imagination with nature and enable our guests to celebrate, connect with and care for the natural world we We This is done by displaying animals in similar environments to that of their homes in order to bring a more realistic feel to the public for their appreciation and to aid them in the education of these animals. They also support the conservation and rescue of wildlife of animals. The main attraction of SeaWorld is their orca whales which people from all over the world come to see and interact with however, in recent years SeaWorld Entertainment has been bashed for their orca whale attraction in regards to captivity and death of both the orcas and their trainers. This is not the case at SeaWorld because they provide a home for them and rehabilitate them. SeaWorld Entertainment is preventing these orcas from dying from social isolation as orcas Shackleford 2 generally travel in the wild in groups that are known as pods but the orcas at SeaWorld have been bred and have been taken care of by the caretakers at the park and they have no knowledge of how to survive in the wild. This brings us to the fact that these orcas would not stand a chance in the wild with other whales and the pollution of the ocean because wild orcas learned to adapt to changes in the ocean while these orcas have been living in really good conditions where their water temperatures and salinity are controlled. The sudden change in the environment would be inhumane for them and cause premature death. For example, Keiko, the whale in Free Willy, was freed and put back into the wild however, he was socially isolated by other whales and died after five (5) years SeaWorld of Hurt is an organization founded by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) that is against the orca whale attraction at SeaWorld parks. This mission is to inform the public that SeaWorld is holding orcas in captivity and instead of living up to their promise of rehabilitating and putting them back into the wild. They also seek to inform people about the horrors of SeaWorld and the effects it has on the orca whales using evidence from various incidents that have taken place at SeaWorld involving deaths of both the whales and the trainers. SeaWorld of Hurt speaks on the fact that SeaWorld keeps their animals to tiny cages and tanks, and [that are forced to perform tricks for tourists in exchange for Other forms of abuse to these endangered animals are that the orcas at SeaWorld are often separated from their mothers and they are confined to swim in small tanks which does not allow them to reach their full potential According to Robert Anderson, Robyn Waayers and Andrew Knight in an article found in Animals, some of the orcas at SeaWorld have been reported for aggressive behaviours towards the trainers at staff. These incidents include submerging trainers, pushing Shackleford 3 them around in the water and mouthing them, leaving bite marks or fracturing bones (8). The orcas would also deceive trainers by seeking attention and contact from a trainer and then attack or lunge at him or her (Anderson et al 11). These forms of aggressive behaviours show the clear effects of having orcas confined to a small cage which does not allow them to swim and live freely. As the years have progressed, the People for the Ethical Treatment for Animals (PETA) have been engaging in various activities to aid the captive animals held at SeaWorld. Activities such as protests and implementing laws are examples. Also, the documentary Blackfish, has increased public awareness of the effects of captivity on the orcas at SeaWorld allowing them to lose millions of dollars because the attendance of the public had dropped significantly and the severing of ties with multiple partners including JetBlue, Taco Bell and Southwest Airlines to name a few In analyzing both sides of the argument, SeaWorld and SeaWorld of Hurt share two things in common. These are the orca whales and the health and well-being for them. Both stakeholders feel the need to protect the orca whales however they just have different views on how it should be done. Therefore, they should come together and share tactics on how to take care of the whales rather than beating down on each other and deeming one side as an animal slaughter house. A compromise that could happen is that SeaWorld should try and introduce larger spaces with a more natural ocean-like feel for the whales so that they can have more room to swim about and feel less confined to such small tanks. According to Michael Mountain, SeaWorld should agree to the use of bigger tanks and end the shows when the remaining orcas die off (Mountain). This compromise would help both stakeholders as the health and well-being of the orcas would be taken into consideration and be improved so that the orcas would have a better life and not held in captivity. Shackleford 4 In conclusion, SeaWorld and SeaWorld of Hurt are two organizations that have the health and well-being of the orca whales in common. However, SeaWorld of Hurt feels that SeaWorld Entertainment is not living up to their promise of rehabilitating and letting back the orcas into the wild where they belong and keeping the animals in captivity instead of keeping them in their small cages where they lash out and cause harm to their caretakers and trainers. In fact, SeaWorld has made progress in where they have made changes to their programs pertaining to the orcas where they are providing a more natural habitat and will be focusing on the natural behaviours of the whales instead of teaching how to perform for a crowd and getting treats in return for their good behaviours Orca This shows that the effects of the protests and backlash SeaWorld of Hurt and other organizations that agree with them are working and making an impact on SeaWorld. This also shows that SeaWorld Entertainment is listening to the outside world and showing the public that they really and truly care for their animals.
