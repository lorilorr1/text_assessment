Gil 1 Ariana Gil Kristin Gocinski ENC1102.078 27 February 2017 NORML Marijuana has been known and used since 2700 BC as a method of medical treatment but was then declared illegal by the 1900s (Boerner 28). This is because during this time the Mexican revolution was taking place resulting in many Mexicans immigrating to America; many of which were frequent marijuana smokers. This frightened people and made them believe that marijuana would make them just like the Mexicans which then caused the ban of marijuana (Boerner 28). Since the illegalization, pro marijuana organizations have been forming a common one being National Organizations for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) founded in 1970 (National Organizations for the Reform of Marijuana Laws). Their main goal is to educate the public on the benefits on medical marijuana and try to legalize the use of marijuana nationwide to reduce the arrests of marijuana smokers. NORML, as a way to promote their position, releases images advocating for the legalization of marijuana. By using the rhetorical appeals logos, pathos, Kairos, and ethos the two images are effectively representing mission. The National Organizations for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) main goal is to educate the public on marijuana and to legalize the use of marijuana at a safe, convenient and affordable cost (National Organizations for the Reform of Marijuana Laws). The NORML organization was founded in 1970 and it successfully decriminalized offences in 11 states during the 1970s (National Organizations for the Reform of Marijuana Laws). They also have a sister organization called the NORML Foundation which sponsors public advertising in order to Gil 2 educate the public about effects and benefits of marijuana (National Organizations for the Reform of Marijuana Laws). This organization is the oldest and the largest pro-marijuana legalization organization in the united states. The NORML organization uses image one in order to advocate their mission and they use the rhetorical appeals logos, pathos, Kairos and ethos as a way to effectively influence the public into legalizing marijuana. The rhetorical appeal logos is presented in image one. Logos is the appeal to logic. It gives the audience reason and evidence for the point of view of the topic of legalizing marijuana. This gives the image credibility because very few people respect claims that do not have any reasoning or evidence. In this particularly, this image represents logos in the facts that it states about marijuana and the legalization of marijuana. The image states a statistical fact about the amount of deaths that have been caused by marijuana. This gives the audience a reason for the organizations position by giving the audience reason and evidence. In this first image, an element of pathos is also demonstrated and this is designed in order to make the audience feel some type of emotion when they see this advertisement. The emotion that is felt is relief due to the positive facts that the image states. The organization stated these facts in order to let the audience know that the legalization of marijuana has some positive Gil 3 outcomes. The image also has the color green which tends to make people feel calm and healthy which also correlates to the fact that marijuana itself is green. An element of Kairos is also present in the first image and this is used in order to give the audience of sense of urgency and timeliness and that they need to act now. In the image is specifically says time to tax and regulate which is asking for the audience to act now in helping the legalization of marijuana to happen. NORML stated all these facts about the benefits of legalizing marijuana and the time to tax and regulate kind of makes the audience want to act now in getting those benefits from legalizing marijuana. The rhetorical appeal ethos is presented in both of the images in a couple of ways. Ethos is the appeal to credibility and it gives the audience a reason to believe that the information is accurate and truthful. In both of the images, the element of ethos is the logo of the organization or the website at the bottom of the advertisement. This also shows that this ad is from the organization itself. This second image has more elements of ethos other than the logo of the organization as stated before. Another element of ethos is the saying NORML to smoke because the name of the organization is incorporated into the slogan. That slogan is also commonly used by the organization its self and its seen on other advertisements. The pro football player is also another element of ethos because he seems to have played in the Super Bowl so he is a well-known player to the sports audience. Gil 4 In image two the rhetorical appeals ethos and pathos are used in order to advocate their goal in their efforts to be effective in legalizing marijuana and reaching their goal. The goal is to slowly make marijuana more socially acceptable in saying that its normal. In this image there is an element of pathos in the way that the image was illustrated. The image has a sort of black filter around the head of the football player giving it a sense of seriousness because black tends to give people the feeling of seriousness and elegance. For the images to be effective in advocating for the legalization of marijuana, NORML uses rhetorical appeals in the images they post. In image one, logos, pathos, Kairos, and ethos were used; image two, has pathos and ethos. These rhetorical appeals seemed to be effective in doing their jobs in advocating mission. The logos in image one is the facts stated in the image because the audience would receive a reason and evidence for claim. Both of the images demonstrates pathos by making the audience feel relieved by the facts being given to them which would then make them more comfortable with the legalization of marijuana. The statement time to tax and regulate is the element of Kairos and it makes people feel the need to help in the legalization of marijuana. Some people may agree with the facts stated in the image and the statement would further push them into acting now. The ethos in both images gave the audience a sense of trust to the information that they are receiving. With the logo of the organization at the bottom of the image, it gives ownership to NORML that the image is theirs. These rhetorical appeals work with the mission statement because they give information Gil 5 about marijuana which educates the public on marijuana. Some might then agree with the information and would help in the legalization of marijuana which is the goal for NORML. NORML advocates for the legalization of marijuana and have history of successful efforts in the legalization of marijuana in certain states. In order to spread information about marijuana and to publically advocate for the legalization of marijuana, NORML releases images on their behalf. These two images presented are effectively representing the goals of NORML by using the rhetorical appeals logos, pathos, Kairos and ethos.
