Even though the problem of child labor in the cocoa industry seen out of hands, and impossible for a common person to make the difference, there are several steps that can be taken to eradicate the problem, one of the most important is to support the brands that are part of The Word Cocoa Foundation or Nestle in Action. It is easy to recognize the products that donate to the cause, most of them have in their wrap a logo of the cause that they are supporting. Furthermore, avoid consuming brands of dubious sources, you can recognize these kinds of brand because they usually do not give information about their supply or the precedence of the ingredients that they use, even the small contribution can have a significant impact in the children lives.
