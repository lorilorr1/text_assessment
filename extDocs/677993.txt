Santos !1 Jordan Santos Spencer ENC 1102 26 February 2017 The Effects of Anesthesia on the Human Body The images selected hear are greatly intertwined and connected to the views of my stakeholder on the position of this topic. The view my stakeholder has on this topic is how anesthesia and it effects on cognitive brain function including the entire human body could increase in the years to come. These images are trying to make the population be aware of this problem and also shed light to people who are completely in the dark about this topic. Topic about the medical field usually do not cause much craze or acquire much attention even though they are relatively important. Most of this topics are overlooked and people continue to think its just another rare side effect that I wont get. Thats the common situation about these things but these images bring great depth and bring startling questions to the public about a very important part in most procedures. Thats is why it is important to clarify this topic and bring sensible information to the public that no experience in the medical field would require you to understand what is coming from these images. To proceed, both images affect the audience by engulfing the audience with pathos. The images both bring alarming questions to the audience. The images bring awareness to the topic by the question of uncertainty that experts even know what the true affects anesthesia has on the human body. This question in image one can be very terrifying and bring doubt in the Santos !2 mind if ever you were to have side effects could the professionals even know how to help you. That is an alarming question to have when there is a lot of trust in doctors to properly take care of their patients in all situations. In image two the question that arises is how going under can bring damage two cognitive brain function. That also can be very terrifying since your brain is your most valuable organ. Parents do not want to see their children have brain damage from going under on anesthesia or any person that has a loved going into surgery have side affects as well. This messages hit many people even if you have no loved ones. This can acquire to even worrying about yourself when you are going into surgery. Furthermore, to touch on the ethos of these images they both come from very credible sources that are constantly being peer reviewed and constantly being updated with new and improved information. This provides clarity to the audience that the information in the image is accurate and proven that there is a sense if uncertainty and the stability of anesthesia and how it affects cognitive brain function and also the human body. Ethos and pathos go hand in hand in the sense that emotion is intensified since you know the information is accurate and is not just a quick scare or a preposterous topic that was completely made up. Also with pathos if the image is believable the audience immediately looks for credibility about the image. Image one is provided by Alila Medical Media which is a very known medical website that bring information constantly to the public and even in the medical world. It is run by very credible doctors that have experience with the topics. Image two is provided by Medical Daily where academic journals can be found and media is usually provided with these journals. This is also peer reviewed and is a scholarly source. Santos !3 Lastly, to touch upon the logic of the images that completely provide a situation to the mind where constant thinking about different scenarios on how this could affect you personally. The images could possibly provide a new way of thinking on how people look at the medical field in general and anesthesia specifically. It could be a starting point to a whole new situation and could be connected to many common effects or illnesses many people suffer from all over the world. This could change how people completely think about situations on how stop some illnesses. The question could arise that the solution to reoccurrence of cancer or other major medical situations could be something that was in front of our faces and such a big part in helping people as well. Will the risk be worth the price many people could pay just to have the chance for a better life since there is no other solution to make procedure possible. These are all questions and logic that must be answered when more people become aware of this topic and effects from anesthesia continue to increase. To conclude, images are very important to all topic they bring light and attention to many thing people know about. Like in this situation where my stakeholder want to shed light on how anesthesia could potentially have fatal side effects and decrease many patients quality of life after going under anesthesia. The images provide almost all of the elements well including pathos, logos, and ethos. The images provided were very sucessful when viewed and understood. They provided hard questions that need to be answered because the people safety is very important to the stakeholder. Santos !4 Image 1 Image 2 Santos !5 Work Cited N.d.
