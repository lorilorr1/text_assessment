Borges 1 Angelene Borges Professor Winkle ENC 1102 29 January 2017 Breed Specific Legislation- Coming Together Breed Specific Legislation (BSL) has been around since the 80s (Weiss). BSL is regulations towards a specific breed of dog that is considered dangerous (Weiss). In the 80s, fatal dogs attacks began to receive more media attention (Weiss). The media influence raised the fear of specific breeds, prompting cities to ban or regulate those breeds (Weiss). While many breeds are on the list of breeds considered dangerous, most cities with BSL target pit bulls. Many groups, dogsbite.org, favor BSL. Dogsbite.org believe that regulation of specific breeds help public safty (Lynn). Other groups, including stopbsl.org, oppose BSL. Stopbsl.org believe that BSL is discrimitory and unsafe (Kray). A compromise that serves the purpose of both organizations, includes all the dogs on the dangerous dog list and does not ban any breed. Instead of fighting each other, the organizations could come together to better reach their overall goal. Dogsbite.org, as stated previously, supports BSL. The founder, Colleen Lynn, started dogsbite.org after being attacked by a pit bull in 2007 (Lynn). The goal is to bring awareness to the public of dog attack victims and their stories (Lynn). Besides the testimonies the website shares, it also supports BSL, including banning pit bulls and mandatory spaying/neutering of pit bulls (Lynn). Between 2005 and 2015, 360 American were killed due to fatal dog attacks with pit bulls being the cause of 232 of those deaths (Lynn). A common slogan Borges 2 is the deed, not the dogsbite.org fights this idealolgy because they want to prevent the attacks from happening (Lynn). By banning pit bulls the number of attacks will decrease dramatically (Lynn). from pit-bull type dogs are thought to be more often associated with fatal or serious injuries as a consequence of their size, build and (Raghaven, et al). Pit bulls jaws do not physically lock, but their style of biting make it hard to get the dog off of the victim which leads it to be commonly said the pit bulls have lock jaw (Lynn). All of these reasons and the many more listed on dogsbite.org contridutes to the organization supporting BSL. Stopbsl.org completely disagrees with dogsbite.org and with all BSL (Kray). Fred M. Kray started stopbsl.org in 2005 and committed to informing on the flaws of BSL (Kray). As well as, informing people of local groups who do not support BSL and of alternatives that could be used instead of BSL (Kray). Stopbsl.org promots responsible dog owners and to look at dogs as individuals instead of punishing the whole breed. Studies done on the effectiveness of BSL in Great Britain and Spain have concluded that BSL did not help in stopping people from being attacked (Campbell). BSL often targets not only the breed of dog that the law is written for, but also any dog that looks like that breed. Numerous dog owners have had their dog taken away and have had to take months to prove that their dog was not a pit bull (Campbell). These legislations also leave pitbull owners defenseless most the time, because they do not grandfather in already owned dogs, even if they have no history of aggression (Kray). Stopbsl.org describes this as of the (Kray). Stopbsl.org list of reason of why BSL should be opposed goes far beyond the ones mentioned. Borges 3 Dogsbite.org and stopbsl.org both care about the safty of people and dogs. Their overall goals are similar. The way they believe the goal will be reached contradicts each other. The two organizations could come together to propose a bill that cities who want to have or already have BSL could use. The bill instead of targeting a specific breed could include all of the dog on the dangerous dog list. This would help with the stigma against pit bulls while still making passing laws that would affect them. Any dog on the dangerous dog list would have to be licenced and have a record. The record would tell of any aggressive behavior that was reported. A record like this would allow the dogs to be handled as individuals the way people are handled. Also the dogs must be spayed or neutered by the age of two. In 2006, 97% of reported dog attacks were by a dog who had not been spayed or neutered (Campbell). This would also help against breeding dogs for years at a time, while still allowing the dog to have puppies if the owner chooses to. Another part of the bill would be to have harsher punishments against people who fight dogs. Pit bulls specifically are normally targeted by dog fighters as their dog of choice. If the punishments for dog fighters was harsher, the number of people fighting dogs would decrease. This would not only take the responsibility off of pit bulls and put it onto the owner, but it would also make it safer for these breeds. Many cities who have historically had pit bull bans have in recent years lifted these bans (Madhani). Between 2012 and 2014 at least 100 cities lifted their ban (Madhani). More cities are reviewing their bans and their current BSL to better suit dog owners and dogs (Madhani). argue the bans have been ineffective in reducing dog bites and led to millions of dogs being (Madhani). At least 18 states have made it illegal for cities to ban pit Borges 4 bulls (Madhani). These cities instead use laws that target owners of dogs instead of specific breeds, helping to eliminate irresponsible dog owners (Madhani). Dogsbite.org and stopbsl.org would both be giving something up with this compromise. Overall, the bill would be targeted at safety which is what both groups want. They comprise some of the way they believe this safety is reached, but it helps the two organizations to work together. The stakeholders would have to agree that what they are giving up is worth the gain they would be receiving (Raghaven, et al). Historically the two have not been able to come to an agreement and not enough research has proven BSL works. A new approach could be beneficial to both groups. Borges 5 Works Cited Campbell, Dana M.
