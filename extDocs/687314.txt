LoPresti 1 Andrew LoPresti Noah Pearlstone ENC 1102 12 March 2017 The Wildlife Conservation Inspiring Imagery The conservation and protection of threatened and endangered species around the globe has become a widely pursued goal for a number of large organizations. According to Endangered Species International, the 44,838 species assessed using the IUCN Red List Criteria, 16,928 are listed as threatened with Species International) Because the proper protection of animal species is such an important current issue, many organizations have begun launching campaigns around the world to not only fund the protection of these species but to physically and directly make a difference towards their survival.

The overarching goal of the organization to conserve the largest wild places in 15 priority regions, home to more than 50% of the (We Stand For Wildlife) Through the use of powerful imagery that highlights the everyday struggles that many animals face every day, the WCS is able to outline the goals of their campaigns and hopefully inspire the public to help them in their pursuits of animal safety worldwide. In these two examples, the WCS clearly outlines the urgency and severity of the current conservation situation as well as the hardships that some animals are attempting to survive with. The first advertisement is an image for one of the many campaigns, the 96Elephants. Created to educate the public about the goal of educating and inspiring the public to take a stand against the mistreatment of animals, this particular campaign image primarily uses elements of logos and LoPresti 2 kairos to make a powerful statement to the public. Logos is used within this image because facts and information are arguably the best way to educate the audience, one of the biggest concerns. The WCS website have provided 400 million guests with immersive, memorable experiences connecting them with animals at our zoos and aquarium in New York (2020 Strategy) While some zoos may have entertainment best values at heart, these zoos partnered with the WCS serve as effective ways to educate large numbers of people about animals and their proper safety.

Pathos is also present within this statement paired with the imagery of the elephants in the background. Mentioning the killing of these elephants is meant to capture the emotions and feel sympathy towards the elephants and the WCS cause. What truly makes this advertisement effective and ties the other elements together is kairos and the call to action which the image demands. a is not only the largest and most important text on the image but it summarizes the purpose of this ad which is to inspire the public to help save the elephants in question. Its wording gives a sense of urgency and suggests that the audience must take action for the campaign to succeed. Similar to the first advertisement, this second image of an obviously stressed primate is meant to educate the public on the struggles that many species experience daily and hopefully lead them towards supporting the cause. The pained face of the primate and the body language that it is hiding is an example of pathos which is used to hook onto the feelings. This imagery seeks to emphasize the negative conditions which these animals are facing and support the idea that the WCS is campaigning to resolve these issues. However, the WCS cannot resolve these issues by themselves and leave it up to the audience using the phrase This phrase not only includes the public into this issue but requests their immediate help in combatting this problem. This sense of urgency and call to LoPresti 3 action is a great example of kairos. Combined with the imagery of the pained animal, this advertisement intends for the audience to feel like they can make a difference. These 2 images effectively convey the goal of protecting animals around the world and help to illustrate the idea that the WCS needs the help to make a difference. Unlike many forms of advertisement, the WCS intended for these images to appeal to all people. Their audience is the general public and these images are used as means to recruit or at least educate as many people as possible. Both of these images try to include the public into the mission statement and emphasize that the public can and must make a difference to the many endangered or threatened species around the world. The WCS ultimately comes down to using pathos paired with kairos in order to create a powerful sense of urgency which can rally the audience to support their organization. Logos is used to educate the audience and describe the true depth of what many species face today as well as highlight why their mission is so important. The conservation and protection of threatened species around the world is a very serious current event and these images provided by the WCS help to educate and inspire the public to make a difference.
