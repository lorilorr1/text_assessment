Anand 1 Dhruv Anand Bob Botkin ENC 1102 18 April 2017 Is it worth treating a life of an animal as a sport or some kind of trophy? Imagine a human being trading places with the animal, consequently making them the target becoming a trophy for a rich wall. Today, people do not think about how they would feel if they were treated the same way they were treating others. Hunting animals has many advantages as animals are very useful and valuable like rhinoceros horn is allegedly a cure of cancer and tusks have supposed to make different medicines. Hunting also generates a large amount of employment. However, there are people in the world who get their basic needs such as food, shelter with the help of hunting. This proves that banning or ceasing hunting is not the solution but trophy hunting is invalid since people are killing animals just to show how brave they are. Animals are becoming extinct because of trophy hunting. Rich people are paying thousands of dollars to national parks and zoos for hunting the endangered animal species. It is not worth killing an animal just for fun because animals have families too. If a parent gets killed by the trophy hunters and the babies of the animals could die of hunger because they do not know how to get food or live independently. Animal species is very important as it also maintain the balance of biosphere of the environment and it is not fair to the animals that they are being killed for fun. Animals hunt or kill their preys or human being for fun, they do it for a reason which is hunger but trophy hunters do it just for fun, there is no advantage of it. Trophy Anand 2 hunting is just like killing a human being for fun and then putting their head as a piece of decoration. In this topic, wealthy people and various national parks play the role of stakeholders but they are in support of trophy hunting. The general public and other wildlife conservation organizations are putting their best effort to ban trophy hunting of endangered species because it has no benefits, only consequences. Wealthy people are just treating the life of animals similar to some other human recreational activity. Many national parks are also selling the endangered animal species to trophy hunters in exchange of thousands of dollars. One of the best example of trophy hunting is Cecil, the lion which was a prey of trophy hunting. Wyatt Smith mentioned, a dentist from Minnesota have paid $54,000 to bow-hunt Cecil, a magnificent, black- maned, 13 year-old lion who lived in Hwange National Park and was well known to (6). This shows that national parks are breaking the laws because trophy hunting is not allowed in national parks but for money, the tour guides and other employees of the national parks are selling the exotic and endangered animal species. This reflects to the problem of corruption which comes up because of trophy hunting. This instance was one of the biggest reason why general public got together and start protesting against trophy hunting. Trophy hunting is generally done by rich people because a common middle class man does not have thousands of dollars to pay for killing an innocent animal. Wealthy individuals and national parks should understand that trophy hunting is bad and this is not a right way to treat innocent animals. Ceasing trophy hunting will save thousands of animal species which are on verge of extinction. Wilson says that, These iconic and disappearing animals are worth more as dead trophies to be mounted and hung on a wall in a Texas mansion than living in the wild in Africa but people should focus more on eco-tourism raising money from people willing to Anand 3 pay to see endangered animals in the (10). Eco tourism can help to maintain the economy of a country because more tourists from different countries will visit that country just to see the endangered species. If some animal species gets extinct, it will directly affect the number of tourist because there is nothing significant left to see in their wildlife sanctuary or national park which will results in depletion of economy. Many wildlife conservation organizations for example U.S Fish & Wildlife Service have organized different protests against trophy hunting to tell the general public that trophy hunting should be banned. In addition people have taken actions by participating in protest against the national parks. The solution to this problem is in the hands of the government. Government should make strict laws that if any trophy hunter kills an endangered species for their own good, there will be strict action taken against them for instance imprisonment or thousands of dollars in fines. Alexander Simon talks about some actions which should be taken by the government, and policymakers should step up their review of how responsibly African nations are managing hunting practices, particularly for wildlife populations that are under stress of trophy hunting, loss of habitat and other (5). This review session will make the national parks and wildlife sanctuaries in Africa a safer place for endangered animal species to live because trophy hunters will no longer be able to bribe the security guards of national parks to engage in trophy hunting. Government has a different role in stopping because they are the creator of every rule or law for any social matter but society also plays a vital role in saving endangered animal species because the quicker people start taking action against it by protesting or doing campaigns against it, the quicker government will get to know that society is having conflicts with this and would take actions because government has a big responsibility to take actions against everything which is creating a problem for the society. That is why our actions Anand 4 and voice is very important for making a difference or taking an action and for the improvement of the future lives. Trophy hunting is not valid because animals have a right to live too and trophy hunting only effects society in a negative because it has drawbacks like corruption, poverty, money and many more Trophy hunting gives a boost to corruption as they give bribes to national parks for doing trophy hunting of an endangered species. Beckie Elgin mentioned that, 3% of the revenue generated by trophy hunting goes towards local communities, with most being concentrated among a few individuals. This creates resentment among (11). This shows that trophy hunting is cause of poverty too. Taking some creatures life is totally not worth it, why trophy hunting should be banned. In the end, the decision is in our hand that whether we want to be against trophy hunting or we are just going to ignore the problem which is directly effecting our society and the future generation. Money is also a big issue because of trophy hunting. According to U.S Fish and Wildlife Service, an average, trophy hunting generates around 1.8% of total tourist revenue in African countries. Ecotourism have been shown to generate 15 times the revenue of trophy hunting (4). This proves that fees paid by the trophy hunters is not even making a big difference in the economy because it is very less. Ceasing trophy hunting will boost the economy 15 times more than what trophy hunting was doing. Not killing innocent animals for fun have much more benefits than killing them in every aspect whether it is moral value of a normal human being or value of an economist.
