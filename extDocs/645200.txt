Corrinne Warnke Ashley Tisdale Composition 1 13 February 2017 Nudity In Art When you think of art what do you see? You may see the image of famous works such as The Starry Night by Van Gogh or the controversial statue of David by Michelangelo. Art has many forms, all of which should be respected. In the past David by Michelangelo was criticized for showing the full male human form in a public so leaves were placed to block the areas that some would deem crude, but today the statue of David stands at Galleria in France with the leaf coverings removed. Michelangelo also painted the ceiling in the sistine chapel, in which he painted the figures in the scene in the nude which caused much outrage by the church and other people of the time. Sadly this beautiful piece of art was modified by the church to add more clothing to all the figures due to the fact they felt it was inappropriate for a religious place. However many sculptures or other works of art consisting of figures in the nude remain controversial today due to many factors such as: religion; the age, mindset, and experiences of the viewer; and if it is appropriate for the setting. This leads us to wonder where does the line between nudity in art and pornography lie in our society today? Lilley, Ed.

It discusses the freedom of speech involved with making artwork with nudity in it and it discusses learning about the human form through this type of art. The main focus is to bring to light why nudity in art a bad thing all the time because it can show the human form and spirit in many different ways because you can view their complete form. However, it does discuss why some people do not like nudity and art and explains how they can avoid it or how to see the artwork in a different light even though they may have issues with it personally.

My third article digs a little deeper into the ideas of art, nudity, and pornography as it discusses how boys and young men experience nudity in art education and why it could be considered pornography rather than nudity due to their perspectives rather than the work of art itself.. The main focus is to examine ideas about sex and professionalism and how it can limit educational experiences. Also it goes into how to examine nudity in art with a focus on the art and how to get your mind in the right framework to be able to discuss these topics in a mature manner. This connects to my research question because it gives me more specifics about how men in society experience nudity in art and why it may seem pornographic to them due to the state of mind in which they view the art. Also it discusses how we can avoid this problem by helping young men in education be in the right state of mind to examine specific works of art.
