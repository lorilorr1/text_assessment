LI 1 Haoxuan Li Ashely Tisdale Composition l 5 March, 2017 Culture Shock and Adaptation Nowadays, more and more people choose to study abroad. As a result, culture shock moves to the forefront of the mind. Culture shock is defined as the feeling of disorientation experienced by someone who is suddenly subjected to an unfamiliar culture, way of life, or set of attitudes. In Newsome, Linda article, there is a sample about feeling which presents the definition: it is difficult to live here. Keeping your identity is difficult, naturally you will be attracted towards that, but it is not my culture. Religion teaches us to stay away from those things, but it is (205).The feeling when we go through culture shock just like we got asthma but people can only tell us to relax. As a major mental and physical problem of international students, culture shock has been focus and studied for several decades. Since the 2000s research has supported claims that the process of overcoming culture shock and adaptation is impacted by the region of origins and their relationships with host/home-country students, motivation and goals. During the 2000s, researchers have found out that international region of origins may greatly influence their adaptation. It can be understood as the differences between two cultures stunted adaptation. life style, common sense, way of thinking and so on, are formed by home-culture environment. When they go to study abroad, they not only need LI 2 to make a good grade but also form a new life in order to adjust to the new environment. If home and host culture are similar, students will have much less pressure. According to Glass, Chris students from Eastern/Southeastern Asia reported significantly more inter/intrapersonal leisure constraints than students from Southern Asia and the Middle East/North (5.1). Eastern/Southeastern Asia have a more developed society and better education system than Southern Asia and the Middle East, so the students who come from the former origins are likely to have a higher education and open-minded which will help students adjust to a new culture. In addition, region of origins always has something to do with the skin colors and religions. Although we recommend people do not be racism or religious discrimination, international students still suffer from it from time to time. Another factor which greatly affects adaptation is relationships. As an essential part of students daily lives, relationships not only stand for friends or partners but social support that they can rely on. But sometimes relationships will bring negative effects to adaptation. leisure constraints were positively associated with socializing with co- national peers and negatively associated with socializing with host national (Glass, Chris R. 5.1). Too much interpersonal relationships with home-country persons are a barrier for adaptation. If a student devotes too much time to make home-country friendships, he is likely to have a hard time going through culture shock because he still lives with his own culture and do nothing to adjust to the new culture. Recreation participations are the outcome of relationships and they can promote each other. Participating in leisure not only help students reduce stress but also give them confidence so that them are able to make more friends. But international students always do not pay attention to participate in leisure. As a result, they miss the opportunity to make friends and relax. of leisure and relaxation could inadvertently exacerbate a sense of LI 3 loneliness or depression, increase stress, and hinder the formation of supportive social (Glass, Chris R 2.1.2). Personal characteristics also play an important role in adaptation. First of all is motivation, it is the decisive factor of adaptation. It decides mental state and attitude, more, motivation is a strong support when student feels depression or confused. more autonomous international students felt in their decision to study abroad, the more likely it was that they would be happier, healthier, and more successful during their V.I. 4.2.1.1). Students will have clear goals and positive attitude if they have high level of autonomous motivation. On the other hand, goals may also have side effect on reducing social difficulties that means unreasonable goals may make students feel upset or depressed. For example, if a student plans to overcome the culture shock within one week but he fails to do it, he may feel depressed and unconfident; those bad emotions make it harder for student to adapt the new environment. higher the importance of the preservation goals the less successful, happy, and healthy are the students at different times of their academic (Chirkov, V.I. 4.2.1.1). So students need to know their abilities and make reasonable goals so that they will not feel disappointed in their selves. In conclusion, researchers have found out that the adaptation of culture shock is greatly influenced by the homelands and their co-nation/home-nation networks, motivations and goals. In order to go through culture shock, students should actively develop relationships with international students and participate in different kinds of events. It is also necessary to have autonomous motivation and appropriate goals for guidance. LI 2 Works Cited Chirkov, V.I., et al.
