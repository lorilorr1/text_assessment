Maningo 1 Malia Maningo ENC 1102 Professor Staiger 29 January 2017 The Conservation of Florida Wildlife Florida is famous for one thing; its natural beauty. The sandy beaches, the lush forests, and the amazing indigenous animals, all contribute to the reason why over 29.3 million tourists visit the Florida Panhandle every year (Dixon, 2016). The select few visitors who come to see the flora and fauna indigenous to Florida are called ecotourists. However, not all eco tourists enjoy the wildlife in a respectful manner, which has resulting in degradation to the Florida habitat. An example is the charter fishing boats scattered throughout the coastline, which according to the Dartmouth Undergraduate Journal of Science, is the greatest threat to ocean ecosystems (DUJS, 2012). Environmental Conservation groups, such as Florida Fish and Wildlife, are doing everything they can to prevent this harm, and are putting up a valiant fight. There are currently fishing guidelines set in place to limit overfishing of certain species, but evidently, it is not working. While these organizations are pushing for stricter protocol, business are pushing back, claiming it will hurt business. With a careful increase in certain guidelines, such as more strict fish harvesting and restricted fishing zones, a compromise that would benefit both stakeholders could be set in place. The first stakeholder would be Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The goal of the FFWCC is to fish and wildlife resources for their long-term well-being and the benefit of (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, myfwc.com). The agency was founded in 1999 after the Maningo 2 Constitution Revision Commission, which allows Florida residents to propose possible amends the state constitution. Since the emergence of this stakeholder, many have noticed the decline of the Florida wildlife. Due to overbearing tourists and fishing charter boats, 93% of coral species has been destroyed, certain species of turtle are endangered, and over half of the everglades have been eliminated (Florida Museum, 2014). These are only some of the harmful effects of urban development. Many acts and laws have been put in place to help slow this depletion of wildlife. An example is the Endangered Species Act of 1973. This act protected the endangered species by allowing the state to buy land if felt needed, prohibited the buying or selling of animals or any animal parts (alive or dead) if they were listed as endangered, and also posted warnings of jail time or fines if the act was violated. Even with the act set in place, the wildlife continued to dwindle, leaving concerned conservationists begging for change. The other major stakeholder in this argument is the charter fishing businesses that use the lush tropical landscape and vast ocean for a profit. These businesses are scattered all over the coast, and is estimated at a $5,000,000,000 business (Florida Trend, Aug. 2013).The downside to the business is the depletion of genetic diversity and fish population in Florida. All business owners have guidelines set in place such as a limit on certain fish, restricted areas, and fines for touching various plants and animals. The owners of the fishing boats, however, do not want these guidelines revised, and disagree with the amends. Similar Disagreements can be seen in other states, such as New York. In 2009, there was a revision to the Long Island Harbor fishing restrictions, which lessened the amount of fish that was available for keeping. The captain of the local charter fishing boat, Mike Vegessi, disagreed with the changes, and claimed, are more fish now than Vegessi also claimed that his revenue went down a considerable amount that year (Science Daily, 8 Apr. 2009). The whole point of these attractions are for Maningo 3 visitors to get up close and personal with the wildlife Florida has to offer, so what will happen if some of the tourists are feeling as though they are not getting their worth? With a compromise that benefits both stakeholders, owners can run their business with happy customers, and wildlife conservationists will not have to worry about the nature being harmed or disturbed. As previously stated, there are guidelines and state laws that are already in place to conserve the wildlife, which are available on the Florida Fish and Wildlife website at http://myfwc.com/about/rules-regulations. Although most are pretty concrete, there are a few regulations that could be revised. For example, the seagrass is a protected plant because it is scarce, and the depletion of this grass has caused manatee population to dwindle. Instead of having signs to warn the fishing boaters, the areas should be blocked off completely to prevent. the possibility of carelessness. Another problem with the current regulations is the tendency of business owners to ignore the laws in order to please customers. If the fines that are listed in the constitution are more strictly enforced, then businesses will realize that neglecting the law will result in a loss of profit. An example of this is the overfishing. If FFWCC boats were deployed and regularly checked and counted the fish intake, the risk of overfishing will be limited, and the captains of the boat will receive a fine. With the regulations and laws revised and the law more strictly enforced, businesses will be more obligated to follow the regulations, and conservation groups will rest easy knowing the nature is not being hurt. The stakeholders will find that this compromise will benefit the both of them. Not only will businesses not receive the warning fines, the will also preserve the nature, resulting in a secure business. Without the nature that Florida provides, the business will not thrive, making it vital that these business do follow the rules. The Fish and Wildlife will benefit from the guidelines because it will keep the state of Florida protected for year to come, successfully Maningo 4 reaching the goal of their mission statement. A recent article by travel weekly reinforces the proposed compromise. In the article, it explains the ongoing struggle of constant environmental harm, and how it may hurt the value of tourism. Robert Silk, a biologist, states Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), which annually spends between $25 million and $40 million on beach restoration and nourishment, estimates that the state now has 407 miles of critically eroded beaches, nearly double the damage that existed when the agency first did such an audit in 1989 (Silk 2015). This damage could potentially harm the billions of dollars of revenue obtained every year. With this compromise, businesses and FWC would not have to worry about possible harming this large tourist industry. There is no doubt that there has been some permanent damage to the wildlife in Florida. However, that does not mean that all hope is lost for the possible rehabilitation of endangered or near endangered species still surviving. With the proposed compromise of more strictly monitored or revised guidelines, this rehabilitation can finally happen. This reconstruction of resources would not only benefit the Fish and Wildlife service which dedicates their agency to conserving wildlife, but also the ecotourist business which thrive off of the beauty of the natural environment.
