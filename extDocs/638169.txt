Connor Heiden ENC 1102 30 Jan 2017 Fried golden white piece of perfection. how id describe a chicken nugget. chicken nugget was invented in the 1950s by Robert C. Baker, a food science professor at Cornell University, and published as unpatented academic work. Dr. innovations made it possible to form chicken nuggets in any one of the leading innovators of the chicken nugget is McDonalds. recipe was created on commission from by Tyson Foods in 1979 and the product was sold beginning in McDonalds did switch it up however by changing the name of their product to Chicken nuggets have been a stable menu item for decades now with no signs of slowing up at all. PETA which stands for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals was created and founded in March 1980.

Both companies have stakes in one item and chickens! PETA wants to make sure that all chickens are raised and cared for properly throughout their life time whereas McDonalds is looking to move their home raised chickens as fast as possible to make the ever good tasting Chicken McNuggets.an agreement on making sure chickens are raised and taken care of properly while also maintaining McDonalds chicken McNuggets craze can be done. Where do you go when you need a quick bite and your short on time, and money? First thing that comes to my mind is McDonalds! McDonalds Whether a 50-piece Chicken McNugget box or a large Big Mac has it all when it comes to a quick meal on the go. is a American burger retail joint found all over the world.

PITAs main job is to make sure that animals are not abused in anyway whatsoever. It reads in their slogan pretty clear. PETA has many accomplishes behind its name. in March 1980 they helped fight the experimentation on 17 Silver Spring Monkeys. The case became major open triggering an amendment to be created. It was called Animal Welfare Act. PETA is a very influential group that cares about what they believe in. it focuses on four core opposition to factory farming, fur farming, animal testing, and animals in entertainment.

Today, USA already purchases more than 13 million cage-free eggs each year, some of which are used in our freshly-cracked Egg not only do there Chicken Nuggets taste great but they are also taking what seems to be extra precautions to the way your food is prepped and handled. This situation is easily fixable. PETA and should sit down and have a meeting to discuss the cruelty happening to their chickens and how they can fix it while not ruining reputation or production numbers. One method that farmers could pick up include CAK or also known as controlled atmosphere killing. According to PETA less cruel, USDA-approved method of chicken slaughter called controlled-atmosphere  or CAK, is now being used in the U.S., and it would cost nothing to demand that its suppliers adopt it. CAK would eliminate the worst abuses currently suffered by chickens killed for In fact, a 2005 study about CAK produced by concluded that it is far better for animals than the current slaughter This would not hurt production numbers or product needs but would help them improve their chicken/animal facilities. a win-win for both parties if you ask me. To Conclude, PETA wants stricter rules put into the poultry industry of whereas McDonalds mind upgrading their facilities to fit PITAS needs but they still need to worry about production and getting product out. Both stakeholders must get together and come up with a plan to change the way chickens are handled on a daily basis at McDonalds participating farms. The one condition that has would be to have to add a longer time table. A perfect example would be the cage free eggs by 2025 mark. about a 10-year period mark from right now and is perfect for production and product needs. It gives them time to slowly transition into a safer and cleaner environment for the chickens without messing up production numbers. This will also fill PITAs needs to help stop the abuse of chickens. Chicken  Wikipedia. Wikimedia Foundation, n.d. Web. 30 Jan. 2017. People for the Ethical Treatment of  Wikipedia.
