ALSHAMSI1 Rashed Alshamsi Instructor Nancy Carr ENC 1101 9 of April 2017 The Development of Computers Initially, computers were confined to a specific area of life that was business. But, late with the emerging new technology and the needs of humans drive this technology in other dimensions of human life. Positivity can be seen in the passion of humans to do all this development. The project will study the development of computer in the light of history and analyze how this technology spread to society and there is a great chance that with the same rate of evolution, the negativity prevailing in this field will further spread. This is the time to think and do something about this. Starting with the era when computers exist, Campbell Kelly in his book A history of information wrote about pre-technological phase of human history in which he wrote about the times when computers exist and humans were the only resources to do any work everywhere. He gave the example of consensus 1890 that consisted of more than twenty thousand pages and took 7 years to write by the efforts of men (14-16). English polymath Charles Babbage, who was a mechanical engineer with the dream of an invention that can help humans in solving mathematical problems. According to Campbell, this was in fact the origination of academic discussion in the form of first researcher in search of impossible. Campbell called Babbage the father of computers because he invented the first mechanical computer that led to the invention of more complex machines after, but this becomes the base of computers in 19 th century (43). This initial stage shows the positivity of human intentions for this development. After the invention of Babbage, the focus of researchers was on to building a machine that can work more efficiently. Universities started programs of research with brilliant minds. Academic discussion adopts a new way and that way was technological advancement. These efforts were in vain for many years, models were produced as Campbell in the history of the ALSHAMSI2 information machine mentioned various attempts on computers by different people. It was not successful until IBM announced Computer 360 (Campbell 88-90). This was the history of computer and here after the announcement of Computer 360 computers formally join the world, computer 360 had small applications and other office related tasks. World was introduced to the computers formally and this is where a little chance of negative use of computers appeared. In 19 th century computer was just a prototype, the real start of computer development started from the designing of generations. The first generation of computers was before the announcement of Computer 360, these were not the actual computers, they have a larger framework and they were only used by big firms, this generations of computer used vacuum tubes and magnetic drums. These computers were not used by common public mostly businessmen used these computers. The second generation of computers was from 1956 to 1963 and transistors were used in these types of computers it had more functions than the first generation and more efficiency due to presence of transistors. With increasing efficiency of computers, world started to notice these machines, government purchased these computers and use it for military purposes. By the time of third generation computers, technological researchers made it easy for common people to use computers. That proved to be a boast up point in history of computers. This was the first time when the mouse and keyboard was used as an interface and commands to computers. Now common people can also understand computer. Third generation also used integrated circuits that made the work fast. The first time the multitasking was possible in a computer. This generation was from 1964 to 1971. As one can observe, with each development, availability of computers become easier for society. Integration of computer in education sector. The fourth generation of computers is long lasted and most used generation that started from 1971 and ended in 2010 until the announcement of the fifth generation. The difference between this generation and last generation was the revolutionary microprocessors brought by the company Intel in market. Computers first take a full room to fit and now a single board was handling all machinery of a computer. IBM introduced computers for home use in 1981. This was the generation where the internet addiction started in the wake of 21 st century. Kimberly S. Young edited in the book, that 21 st century was the time when people become distant from other people. It is a mindset that is spreading through ALSHAMSI3 humans. This behavior is affecting the society, in other words we can say that these machines are controlling us. The book proved by examples the current condition of people due to addiction is really miserable. (Young 15-20) The fifth generation is not fully developed, some of the technologies are still emerging as the form of artificial intelligence in computers. Academic discussion is going towards the development of artificial intelligence as a mean to make computers that can think like humans. This is the new way that academic researchers and thinkers are now on (Sixth Generation of Computers 2011). Taking the discussion to a counter argument by the paper of J M. Wilson published in Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes journal. An experiment shows that 2 different teams, one with daily face to face interaction and other with virtual interaction through computer. People with face to face interact, trust each other more than people that interact via computer trust each other (Wilson 8). So, this was the result that the researchers found after experiment and it shows that people still feel insecure in trusting someone on the internet. Richard Rosenberg in his book Social Impacts of wrote that computers are everywhere. Then he gave the example of the business world, medical, education, governmental works, personal life, etc. He gave the example of 9/11 when people used internet to inform their loved ones about their safety at that time internet played a positive role (Rosenberg 3). Another counter argument in the opposition of computer negativity thesis can be the D-CAT test. In other words, the Depression Test. This is a new technique by which humans can measure the depression and by this a lot help can be given to humanity (Hobert 2005). Now, the academic discussion is turning towards the negative impacts of computers on society. As written by Richard, computers, indeed are everywhere and this is an alarming situation. Everyone has the access to information about others, if not common people, governments have access to personal data of every single person living in their country and using the internet. Free speech is the right to humans, but people are using this right in a manipulative way and hurting others by using the shield of free speech (106- 110). Later, discussion turns to the issue of privacy protection of personal and collective data. Viruses, worms and hackers are corrupting the data present on the internet, this can lead to a social catastrophe. ALSHAMSI4 Work Cited Campbell-Kelly, Martin.; Aspray, William. (2014).
