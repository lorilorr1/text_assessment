Student 1 Student Instructor Lewis ENC 1102 29 January 2017 The Power of Solar Power Since the mid man has looked towards fossil fuels to be the power behind their beacon of hope for a better world. Now, however, we understand that there are fundamental issues surrounding the quantity of these resources that society is consuming. It is therefore only logical that an alternative source for power is utilized to negate the side effects from the current situation. Solar City has made it their mission to take people down the road to clean, renewable resources to be able to sustain humanities lust for power indefinitely. Solar City was founded in 2006 by Lyndon Rive, a man who is currently the CEO of the company as well. In order to convince the average consumer of the benefits of purchasing solar cells, Solar City has started a marketing campaign aimed at showing people the benefits, and the practicality using solar technology, as well as the cost of continuing down the current path of using carbon based energies. A perfect example of Solar marketing techniques can be found in their images of what it would look like if people used their products. This picture (see Fig. 1) is an attempt by Solar City to give a visual depiction of what life could be like with their technology. The perfectly green lawns, foggy mountains in the background, and a blue sky on top to tie it all together. There are two main messages that come from this photo. The first is that this vision of a solar powered world is possible and practical. With the whole neighborhood comprised of houses Student 2 with Solar solar panels, a larger picture is painted of how communities can come together to achieve a common goal. This, of course, assuming that the viewer already knows that about the costs of not harnessing an alternative energy. The second message is of how much better the environment would be if solar energy was used over fossil fuels. It is easy to see that the atmosphere of the picture is clean and clear. A beautiful environment that may only be due to the use of solar energy, or at least what is being depicted. The tone of the image is one of tranquility. Peaceful and calm, as if those solar panels are what brought on such bliss. This image makes appeals to logos and kairos more so than any other appeal. The logical aspect is fairly simple. If somebody want to live in a place like that, then the first step is to by solar panels for their house. Since the image is visually appealing, it only makes sense that the average person would want what the image has to offer, meaning that the implied step of a switch to solar must be taken. The second appeal is kairos, and it coincides with logos very strongly. Look at the mist in the background. That fog is covering all, and if it were not for the solar panels, perhaps that fog would cover these houses as well. A bright and sunny day is what lies ahead for the Solar City customers who live in the houses in the foreground. The reason this message is kairos is because it calls for immediate action. If something is not done now, then this image may fade into the same fog which sits in the distance. This picture (see Fig. 2) is telling a similar story as figure 1, however the goals are not entirely the same. Solar City came up with a new solution for some of the problems that currently plague solar technology. In this case, the problem was a capitalistic appeal rather than purely environmental. The seen on the roof of the house in the image is a response to people who may be avoiding making the switch in order to preserve the design sophistication Student 3 of their house. The house on display in this photograph is unaffected in appearance by the Solar Roof, and due to the glow of the sun, the roof looks even more appealing. The luxury car parked in the garage gives off that this product is for classy people. Sunset in the background beneath the blue sky, purple and green fields in the distance, and well manicured lawn in the foreground. The tone of the image is very similar to figure one as well, with its heavy us of blue and green, but there is an extra amount of reds and yellow. The tone is also aimed at giving off a feeling of tranquility, but this time meant more as a complement to the dreamscape world that this image offers. Logos and pathos as the most significant appeals made in this image. Logos is a sort of universally binding force behind all decisions. Is somebody want outcome B, and doing A leads to B as a result, then A is the primary step that should be taken. If somebody want to live in a house a beautiful as that of the picture, with land as alluring as that of the picture, then a Solar City Solar Roof may be the first step towards achieving that goal. There are no powerlines or transformers to be seen near that house, therefore that house must be getting power primarily from the solar panels which also seem to be charging that electric luxury car. If someone wants all that, then a Solar Roof is a logical first step. Pathos is used to enhance the persuasion of the solar technology. The warm colors from the sunset paired with the elegance of the house make for a strong combination. Both images make similarly strong appeals to emotions, logic, and timeliness, but each having their own goals. Both images show that by using solar energy as a primary energy, realities that were previously thought not possible become attainable. All the perfection in the land can still be preserved, but action must be taken quickly. The general public must Student 4 know of the risks and rewards of using an alternative energy before it is too late to make a change.
