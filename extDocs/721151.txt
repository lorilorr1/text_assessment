Barnett 1 Payton Barnett 15 March 2017 Sarah Basil Composition II University of South Florida Community and Deforestation Students at the University of South Florida use paper in classes, as flyers, for writing down contact information such as phone numbers, and for trashcan basketball, but how much of this paper is recycled? According to the Campus Recycling Program and Energy Conservation page of website, has recycled over 7100 tons of 7100 tons may seem like a lot, but in 2016 the annual amount of paper used in the US was 9.125 billion tons, and the total number of trees cut down for that paper use was 4 billion (Paper Use Statistics). Trees are incredibly important for not only our environment or wild animal homes, but they provide the oxygen that we breathe. The Earth Policy Institute Indicators page mentions that forests currently cover 31% of the land surface, and the World Wildlife overview on deforestation states that the equivalent to 48 football fields of forest are lost every minute. Students at the University of South Florida can help to combat deforestation by being educated, being engaged, and being empowered on the topic of deforestation. Deforestation should matter to the USF community, both students and staff, because if we can increase the tons of recycled paper it would help lessen the effects of deforestation. Deforestation is defined as the action of clearing a wide area of trees, like a forest. Forests provide important products such as timber and paper, but they also supply essential services, for example they filter water, protect soil, regulate climate, and provide habitats for Barnett 2 countless animal species and space for recreation (Earth Policy Institute indicators). When deforestation was at its highest in the 1990s, the world lost an average of 16 million hectares (1 hectare = 2.4 acres) each year which is roughly the size of the state Michigan. But these global rates of deforestation do not fully capture the damage done to the forests, there are many means that compromise the health of remaining forests such as selective logging, road construction, and climate change. With each year that passes the world has less forest area, and the forests that remain are of a lower quality. Replacing forests that have been natural grown with trees of an exotic species reduces biodiversity greatly. But the amount of planted forests has been rising from an expansion of 3.7 million hectares annually in the 1990s to 4.9 million hectares annually in the 2000s. Today, planted forests count for nearly 7% of total forests (Earth Policy Institute indicators) . In order to reduce forests being cut down, paper needs to be recycled and not thrown into the trash. The percent of landfill solid waster comprised of paper is 16%. If that number were reduced by half, there would be less waste in landfills and more paper. Deforestation has a negative impact on the environment, and the most dramatic impact it has is the loss of habitat for millions of species. 80% of land animals and plants live in forests and cannot survive the deforestation that destroys their homes (National Geographic). Trees are an important factor in climate change due to the fact that they absorb the greenhouse gases that fuel global warming, less trees and fewer forests means less greenhouse gases getting absorbed and this would increase the speed and severity of global warming (National Geographic). If people reduce the amount of paper they use, and also recycle all of the paper they use that can be recycled, there would be less of a need to cut down trees. Wood would still be used for architecture and furniture, but 42% of wood harvested goes to paper production, and halving that number would be a dramatic and much needed impact on deforestation. Even just Barnett 3 reducing that number by 1% or 2% would be a change for the better; no matter if it does not make an enormous wave of change, baby steps are important. The smallest difference is still a difference. There are countless organizations and agencies against deforestation that can be donated to or joined. The Rainforest Action Network for the forests, their inhabitants and the natural systems that sustain life by transforming the global marketplace through education, grassroots organizing and non-violent direct (Rainforest Action Network mission and values). The World Wildlife Fund has been protecting the future of nature for over 50 years. Nature and Culture International have helped to protect over 13 million acres of threatened ecosystems in Latin America. Save The Redwoods goal is to and restore redwood forests and connect people with their peace and beauty so these wonders of the natural world flourish. There are ways to donate or get involved on each of these websites, from sharing paints, drawings and poems of redwoods to call attention to these specific trees all the way to joining a march put on by the WWF in Washington, DC, even to donating any amount of money you can spare. There are other ways to combat deforestation if you do not have spare time or spare money, you can recycle your papers and plastics. There are recycling bins in buildings all over the University of South Florida campus that are marked clearly. And if you can donate either time or money, do not forget to recycle anyway. Education on deforestation would help the University of South Florida community to understand the gravity of this issue, engagement in organizations make a difference, and feeling empowered to make a change can help reduce deforestation. The USF community is already recycling, as shown by the Campus Recycling Program and Energy Conservation page on their website with lists of what the university can and does currently recycle, as well as with some Barnett 4 statistics on how many tons of paper USF has recycled. This is a starting point, if more of the University of South community gets involved and passionate about trees and deforestation there is no doubt the recycling statistics would go up and much less paper would be used. The effects of deforestation would be lessened, no matter how small or how great, if the University of South Florida community is educated, engaged, and empowered on the subject.
