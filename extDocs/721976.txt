Casey Morocho Hannah Lay ENC 1102 10 April 2017 SeaWorld Versus USF Students For the past several decades, SeaWorld Entertainment & Parks have had numerous animal abuse claims brought against them by different types of organizations. Some of these claims vary from artificial insemination to psychological damage to the animals. With substantial proof to support these animal abuse claims, PETA is one of the organizations that constantly fights for the rights of the animals at SeaWorld. SeaWorld, while owning over 800 species of animals, usually ignore the claims brought against them (SeaWorld Parks &Entertainment). However, people worldwide should help PETA and other organizations achieve their goal. More specifically, a call of action should be brought closer to home such as students at the University of South Florida. In regards to the USF student community who hold an interest in animals, they should care about the animal abuse claims PETA has against SeaWorld Entertainment & Parks because animals should be treated humane and not kept in captivity for human exploitation. To help PETA achieve its goal of gaining freedom for the animals at SeaWorld Entertainment & Parks, the USF student community should follow social media sites, support petitions against SeaWorld parks, and avoid visiting any parks owned by the corporation. Established in 1959, SeaWorld Entertainment first started out as a bird sanctuary and garden in Tampa, Florida. After several years, the corporation has expanded tremendously while keeping its focus on animals. Currently, SeaWorld Entertainment & Parks owns over 7 different entertainment parks across the world that revolve around the theme of animals. It is considered the theme park and entertainment company in the (SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment). Annually, SeaWorld Orlando alone has over 20 million guests to come visit the animals that they hold. All the entertainment parks under the name share the same mission of being the foremost zoological organization. (SeaWorld Entertainment & Parks). They also believe in bringing a interactive and educational experience that blends imagination with nature to enable guests to celebrate, connect with and care for the natural (SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment). However, SeaWorld Entertainment & Parks have continued their tradition of trapping animals for human exploitation which violates an right to freedom. With SeaWorld Orlando being the most profitable and well- known, the money that the company receives allows them to stay open and keep the animals in their artificial habitats. Even though SeaWorld Entertainment & mission statement is to care for the animals while providing an amazing experience for their guests, the company crosses the line and does things that would be considered animal abuse. To have orcas perform in their shows with trainers, SeaWorld had to capture baby orcas from the ocean. This would require fishing boats, planes, and dangerous fishing nets (PETA). Separating baby orcas from their pack does psychological damage and allow the baby orcas to know how to live in the wild if they were ever to return (Briefer & McElligott). Another action that SeaWorld does that takes away the rights is how they live at the parks. All the animals are put in fish tanks that sometimes might be too crowded with animals of the same species which makes the tank to become too small to live in. Small enclosed living spaces can cause stress levels and behavioral (Briefer & McElligott). SeaWorld Entertainment & Park also host a breeding program to make profit off their animals. It is most commonly done with their orcas. As part of this program, SeaWorld trainers have to masturbate the orcas to receive the sperm which would be then be artificially inseminated. Once the female orcas get pregnant, the corporation waits until the babies are born to once again separate them. These actions performed by SeaWorld Entertainment greatly affects the well-being of their animals. Most people wonder why we should care about animals at entertainment parks. Some people believe that an well-being should not be an important thing to worry about. They are not human so their well-being is something that should be ignored. However, that is not the case. Several studies have shown that animals are intelligent and can be psychologically damaged from the actions of humans. When SeaWorld takes away baby orcas from their mothers, they are taking away the natural world. The baby orcas are moved to poor welfare conditions such as deprivation of space, resources, physical contact, and other activities experienced in a more natural setting (Briefer &McElligott). Thankfully, there are numerous ways to help animal rights organizations free the animals at SeaWorld. One way to do this is to bring the issue into the mainstream light. USF students who hold an interest in animals can educate other people on the matter. They can talk to their peers and attend rallies together. They can help host fundraisers to send money to the organizations against SeaWorld. Hopefully by doing so, the people they tell will get interested and join the movement for freedom. Once the people are interested, signing petitions against the entertainment company will help. There are several petitions being held, nationally and statewide. Another way to help is by following the social media sites that are subscribed to organizations against SeaWorld. An example would be PETA. By following their social media sites, their network of people grow which also helps relay out the message of what SeaWorld is doing to their animals. No matter how big a corporation is, such as SeaWorld Entertainment & Parks, the well-being of their animals should be their first priority. Actions that would be considered animal abuse and inhumane are actions being done by SeaWorld. The mission statement is to care for animals and their natural world. But what natural world are they living in when the animals experience psychological and physical damage? Making sure that the animals live in what is considered their natural world, such as open waters, should be important to the corporation. Factors such as these should be considered in decisions SeaWorld makes about their animals. Hence why giving back their animals freedom is the goal for many organizations and should be the goal for the USF student community. Works Cited About  PETA. N.p., n.d.
