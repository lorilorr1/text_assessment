Singer 1 Molly Singer Professor Davis ENC 1102 26 February 2017 Project 2 Intermediate Draft SeaWorld is a widely recognized aquatic themed park, providing entertainment using marine mammals such as killer whales, and dolphins in shows and other attractions. The foundation of this once beloved theme park was shaken in 2013, when a documentary by the name of Blackfish was released. The documentary covers the controversy of keeping animals like killer whales in captivity, and painted SeaWorld as a business that did not truly care for the animals it hosts. Since premiere at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival, public attitude has turned hostile towards SeaWorld with many people calling for the park to stop breeding its marine mammals and using them in shows. In response to all the negative feelings towards the theme park, SeaWorld has created many images, videos, and a calling for the public to see the truth about what goes on behind the scenes at SeaWorld with its marine mammals. Through the use of rhetorical strategies, both figure one and figure two relate to goal of clearing its name of the negative accusations that came from Blackfish, and putting forth mission to provide an interactive and educational experience to help connect and care for the natural world. What was originally supposed to be an underwater restaurant, SeaWorld has expanded into three parks in San Diego, CA, San Antonio, TX and Orlando, FL. First opened in 1965, the San Diego park was the first SeaWorld. Initially, it only had dolphins and sea lions exhibits, but following the fruitful first year the park experienced, the first Killer Whale, Shamu was captured Singer 2 and brought to the park in 1965. Since then, SeaWorld has continued to be one of, if not the top, marine theme parks opening the Orlando park. In growing the business, SeaWorld has helped develop many of the standard care and breeding practices used for marine mammals in captivity. Despite having such good business for a few decades, SeaWorld has recently come under fire from both the public and many animal rights groups since the release of the documentary Blackfish which showed SeaWorld in a less-than flattering light. The documentary depicts SeaWorld of being a facility that does not truly provide the care for Killer Whales as it says it does, saying that the marine mammals are put under a lot of stress from having to perform and not having the appropriate social interaction with other Killer Whales like they would in the wild. Blackfish also calls SeaWorld out about not providing accurate facts about their animals, twisting the truth about the animals to fit what SeaWorld needs the public to know. After the documentary came out in 2013, SeaWorld has been greatly trying to reinvent its image in the public eye. current mission statement is more than 50 years, we have been a leading theme park and entertainment company delivering personal, interactive and educational experiences that blend imagination with nature and enable our guests to celebrate, connect with and care for the natural world we (Who Are We, n.d.). This has included turning the attention of the park more towards the conservation of marine mammals, advocating for their rights, and providing a more educational experience for guests. In addition, SeaWorld has created a couple of teams to help brighten their image: Truth Team to discredit much of the negative image that Blackfish created for the park, and in July 2016, the SeaWorld Action Team, which anyone can join to help conserve, protect, and educate their local community about nature and the animals around them. The park has also announced that it will stop breeding its Killer Whales, making current family of orcas, its last generation. Singer 3 Even with all the improvements the park is making, SeaWorld Entertainment Executive, Joel Manby says he never expected this change in policy to completely alleviate the situation, but stays optimistic that future changes will help SeaWorld get back on the good side (Martin). Following the release of Blackfish, SeaWorld released many images with a goal to get the public to look past what the documentary was saying and to what SeaWorld has going on behind the scenes. Figure 1 was posted on twitter, and includes a link to a SeaWorld website that clarifies what SeaWorld is trying to do for the animals. Since it was posted on twitter, the main audience for this photo would be the public because many people use that social media platform. Also it can be seen that the tweet was promoted, meaning that most people using the site would see it, if not just intended audience. As for the use of ethos, pathos, logos, and kairos in the image, all four could be of use. For ethos, the image shows a woman in a uniform, so it would give her the credibility associated with being a trainer. It would make sense that as a trainer of the animals that she would be trustworthy because she is working directly with the killer whales and would know their condition, and how they are treated at the park. Furthermore, logos somewhat goes hand in hand with the use of ethos because it also goes back to the fact that the lady shown is a trainer, and it is logical to think that a trainer who works with and cares for the animals would be telling the truth. Pathos is displayed mostly in the words on the picture which read, thing I want people to know after watching the movie is that not This shows pathos through the way that in the quote is shown in yellow while the rest of the words are in white, not only pushing that word to stand out among the words, but of the whole picture. It is indicating a sort of strong emotion in the voice of the trainer speaking. Singer 4 Lastly, kairos is invoked in the image because it was sent out on twitter after many people have seen Blackfish and were having negative feelings towards SeaWorld parks and their practices. Moving on to Figure 2, this picture has the same goal as Figure 1, but has a different approach in achieving the goal. Whereas with Figure 1, the picture could have been aimed at the public, animal rights groups, and pretty much anyone who has seen Blackfish, Figure 2 is more directly aimed towards the public, and trying to have them more involved in what happens with SeaWorld, and in turn showing the people they know that SeaWorld so bad. This picture is something that would be posted, or shared on any social media platform by members of the public versus it being posted by SeaWorld. Ethos is created by this picture by the SeaWorld logo in the bottom, and the fact that it would be posted by someone the viewer would know. Depending on what the relation is between the poster and the viewer, it would seem trustworthy since someone the viewer knows agrees with SeaWorld, making SeaWorld seem more positive. Along with that, pathos is invoked by somewhat making the viewer seem guilty if they join the Truth Team since someone they know has joined it, and the way is presented as the biggest words, challenging the viewer. The figure also makes it seem like joining the right thing to do, appealing to logos. Kairos is important in this image because it was sent out after SeaWorld made substantial changes in what its focus is on. Overall both figures really played on ethos the most, and used logos to support it. While pathos was used, it was not a huge factor in having the photos make a lasting impact, and kairos was important, but kind of a given since they came out after the majority of people have seen Blackfish. Ultimately, both figures do help achieve the goal of promoting positive image and spreading the word of the good they are now doing for the animals.
