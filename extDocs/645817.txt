Pittard 1 Tani Pittard January 29, 2017 SeaWorld currently holds the largest known number of captive animals in any theme park in the North American continent. This makes the company a huge target for PETA to attack on animal rights issues. If PETA could have it their way, there would be no SeaWorld and all animals would roam free in their natural habitats. According to their main website, SeaWorlds goal is to teach families from all over the world that it is important to care for all animal species. It follows that a large number of the animals in captivity at SeaWorld are rescues and otherwise could not survive in the wild. It is well known that PETA is all about saving and caring for animals, so it is plausible that with the two of them working together more animals could be safer and healthier. According to the website, groups similar to PETA such as the ESA and AWA have the practices at SeaWorld. If PETA along with these other groups would donate a certain margin of money to SeaWorld each year, the company could more money into the animals habitats and general health. SeaWorld would benefit by making more profit, while PETA would benefit because the animals would then be safer and healthier. SeaWorld is first and foremost, a company. In order to keep a company running, the said company must make enough revenue each year. For SeaWorld specifically, this profit is made by guests coming to visit the parks. The animals in the park are a big reason as to why many of the visitors pay to come. According to the New York Times, SeaWorld is worth an estimated 2.5 billion currently. Whether guests come to watch the animals strictly for enjoyment, or to learn about them, they are coming to see the animals. For this reason, if the animals were to just disappear SeaWorld would lose a lot of income. SeaWorld has taken in multitudes of rescues which would have probably died if left in their natural habitat. It is said that many of these Pittard 2 animals need human assistance in order to live a longer and more fulfilling life. On SeaWorlds site it states that over their fifty years of rescuing animals they have saved over 28,000 animals. This is the case with most rescues, and most organizations support what SeaWorld has to offer these animals. According to Animal Welfare Program, programs and policies are affirmed by numerous federal and state laws, including the Animal Welfare Act, Endangered Species Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act and other All of these animal rights organizations believe that SeaWorld truly cares about these animals. So it is not hard to believe SeaWorld would put more money into the habitats if they received donations. PETA, likewise, is focused on keeping animals around the world safe. However, PETA prefers animals to stay in their natural habitats. On the front page of their website, it says that PETA was founded on the core belief that you should not mess with nature. Although PETA has yet to join affirmation list, they have said several negative things to say about animals held in captivity. One of members who used to work as an animal curator in different wrote that and other theme parks which have animals, people that it is acceptable to interfere with animals and keep them locked up in captivity, where they are bored, cramped, lonely, deprived of all control over their lives, and far from their natural This is a perfect example of how PETA feels toward all types of animal captivity. However, many of claims are made based on the idea that all enclosures are not enough like their natural habitats. With more funding from animals rights activists put the animals SeaWorld would have PETA working by their side. PETA believes animals should have the same rights humans do. Meaning they believe that animals should not be taken out of their natural habitat. This belief has been seen as controversial because certain animals have the physical capacity to survive in the wild. On Pittard 3 the website, it is stated that SeaWorld has saved countless amounts of animals from sea turtles with cracked shells, giving wet suits to injured manatees, to bottle feeding orphaned animals. There are some cases, though rare, when the animals do not have the best life in captivity. For example, Tilikum, the famous orca whale which killed his trainer while in captivity. It is said that Tilikum only killed his trainer because he was taken away from his mother and had been in such a confined space for so long that he simply went mad (4). Tilikum is one of the reasons PETA is so against having animals in captivity. He is a prime example of what can go wrong if not cared for properly. This is why groups such as the ESA which already support SeaWorld should join forces with PETA in donating money which would be put toward the animals enclosures and healthcare. Not only would the larger enclosures draw in more guests due to the more accurate presentations of nature, but it would also make SeaWorld more educational. Accurately demonstrating what goes on in the wild without harming the animals or the watchers. This funding would also benefit PETA as the more endangered species would be safe from poachers and more rescues could afford to be made. Both of these stakeholders care deeply about the health and well being of animals. SeaWorld strives to not merely entertain their guests, but to care for these animals which they own. Likewise, PETA cares deeply about the well being of all animals. With these two organizations working together, more animals could be safe and healthy. PETA sees SeaWorld as a company which needs money from people wanting to view these animals for entertainment, when in reality SeaWorld is much more than that. PETA wants animals to be left alone in the wild while SeaWorld wants to show the beauty of these exotic creatures to the world. PETA may not realize that main goal is to encourage guests to take care of animals. This goal of SeaWorld could be enough to get PETA to join them and the other groups in donating to the Pittard 4 habitats of SeaWorld in order to show the world that it is necessary to protect the animals and to take care of them. PETA is generally against animals being held in captivity at all. However, with this compromise, these two entities can better protect all animals and the environment around them. After all, both parties consider animals to be friends, not foes. Pittard 5 Works Cited Zoos: Pitiful  PETA. N.p., 2017. Web. 25 Jan. 2017. Entertainment, SeaWorld Parks &.
