Kennard 1 Emily Kennard Professor Hanson ENC 1102 16 April 2017 Animal Testing: More Harm Than Good? Have you used perfume or cologne today? How about makeup or deodorant? If the answer is yes, then there is a possibility that you have contributed to the disgustingly harmful and inhumane tests that are performed on innocent animals every day. In fact, million animals are used in experiments (excluding rats, mice, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and agricultural animals used in agricultural experiments), plus an estimated 100 million mice and (Mukerjee). Many people think that cosmetic testing on animals is only the makeup products being rubbed onto the bare skin of the animals. Seems pretty innocent. Except, the reality is much worse than that. Animal testing needs to be banned because it is not helpful towards the reactions humans may receive from the cosmetics. Right now, you can help end the suffering of many innocent animals. Animals do not simply undergo skin irritation tests where the already created cosmetic item has already been created and is simply rubbed onto an exposed area of skin on the test subject. Animals undergo many different tests ranging from inhalation, consumption and even eye irritations. One example of the tests that animals endure during this laboratory time is the Draize eye test. This involves a standardized protocol for instilling agents onto the cornea and conjunctiva [of the lab (Wilhelmus). This means that the animals have chemicals forcibly shoved into their eyes to see how their eyes could react. Many of these animals end up blind due to this test. To put this into perspective for humans, imagine the burning feeling of Kennard 2 getting shampoo in your eyes but multiply it by one thousand fold. Another test is the skin irritant test where chemicals are rubbed onto hairless rats to see how they react to it. The results show redness and fluid accumulation under the skin of these animals. According to an article written by Maibach Marzulli, the results between the skin irritant test on the hairless rats compared to those on a human subject show a considerable difference; it is more irritating to the rats than it is to man. Also, radioimmunoassay of skin prostaglandin E disclosed no differences between irritated and control skin, suggesting that this technique cannot be used as an objective measure of skin (Marzulli). If one test can be scientifically proven to not be beneficial to the results that humans may have, what other tests may not be working? In order for everyone to fully comprehend what animal testing is, an explanation of what exactly happens during these experiments needs to be discussed. Cute little rabbits and mice are brought into a lab. They have tubes forcibly shoved down their throat and needles poked into their eyes. All of their hair is shaved from their bodies. With each needle, tube, and patch of skin, chemicals are forced into and onto their bodies. Many animals go blind, are paralyzed and are burned during these experiments. The lucky animals die during the procedures. The lucky ones that live, later have their necks broken and all animals are eventually tossed to the trash. How many animals are treated this way? million animals used in experiments and 78,294 animals are subjected to severe pain near, at, or above the pain tolerance threshold of un- anesthetized conscious (Canadian Council). This means that no animals undergo anesthesia during these tests. These animals can feel every single needle, tube and burn on their bodies. The astonishing thing about this whole situation is that the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) require animal testing to be performed on new cosmetic products (Graef). This means that many name brand cosmetic companies choose to test on innocent Kennard 3 animals. With new innovating ways to test the reactions that humans receive from cosmetics being discovered daily, why are cosmetic companies still choosing to test on animals? This is because a large target market in China demands these name brand companies. For the selling of all cosmetics in China, they are required to be tested on animals to prove their safety Rules On Animal This is absolutely insane because there are advancements in synthesized skin already made that has proven to work more effectively than the use of animals, and it has already been scientifically proven that the testing that is performed on animals gives no medical advancements as to how humans will react to these cosmetics. There are many different ways for you to help the stop and prevention of animal testing. One way is to boycott all cosmetic companies that test on animals. PETA (the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) has compiled a list of all cosmetic and household companies that test on animals. You can find the list on their website. Another way is to sign a petition with the humane society. This organization has so many different petitions that people can sign to help animals in different areas, not just the ones involved with animal testing. Visit their website for more information on all the different types of petitions they have to offer! Thirdly, you can donate to companies like LUSH cosmetics. LUSH cosmetics raises money to give away with their LUSH Prize Award. This award offers two hundred and fifty thousand pounds, the equivalent to $313,518, to the people that are advancing the findings of non-animal testing regulations for toxicity Is The LUSH Finally, you can write to your local state representative; the closest one to the University of South Florida is Kathy Castor; and say that you want a bill to be written and brought to the capital to help against the purchase and creation of cosmetic products that have been tested on animals. It may come across as unlikely that a bill like this would be passed, but something similar has already been passed and is currently in Kennard 4 effect within the European Union. The Cosmetics Directive was created to help with the phasing out of animal testing for cosmetic purposes. More specifically, prohibition to test finished cosmetic products and cosmetic ingredients on animals and [it prohibition to market finished cosmetic products and ingredients in the EU which were tested on on Animal If the European Union can ban animal testing in all twenty-eight countries that follow under its ruling, why the United States follow suit? To conclude, it may seem as though animal testing is extremely innocent, it is actually extremely harmful toward cute innocent little animals. They suffer every day for the sake of humans to have comfort in cosmetics. Although it may seem as though animal testing may never be banned, steps are being made to eventually reach that goal. Even an everyday person as yourself can make a huge impact by doing one of the things mentioned above. Every small voice adds together to create an uproar. That uproar is justice for all of the animals that suffer every day for our comfort. Kennard 5 Works Cited Ban on Animal  European Commission. N.p., n.d. Web. 16 Apr. 2017.
