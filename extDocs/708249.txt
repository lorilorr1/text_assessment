Student 1 Student Kimber Wiggs ENC 1101 16 April 2017 Prostitution: Reclaiming Female Sexuality and Sexual Autonomy Within the scope of modern feminism, perhaps no profession has elicited such divisive opinions as prostitution. Prostitution as a field of work is one that is celebrated by some as an expression of female sexuality and sexual autonomy, or a ability to engage in sexual activity without societal stigma, while shunned by others, who would consider prostitution to be one of the most damaging systems of oppression affecting women today. To pinpoint the circumstances in which this conversation occurs, it is first necessary to define what is considered feminism. Feminism is a movement that can be traced back to at least the early twentieth century, where its first historical division, or was associated with the goal of suffrage. Since then, feminism has experienced a a period which is generally associated with the 1960s and the sexual revolution, wherein women and other social groups made advances towards destigmatizing sexuality through milestones such as the normalization of birth control or the practice of sexual activity before marriage. Beyond this point came third-wave feminism, which is often marked as having occurred from the 1980s to the present. It is within this time frame of second- and third-wave feminism that this conversation takes place, as prostitution is directly rooted in modern attitudes towards female sexuality. To better understand the terminology used between those that would support the Student 2 practice of prostitution and those standing in diametric opposition to it, the terms and will be used here. Radical feminists are those feminists who oppose any attempts at exerting control over female sexuality, in which they view prostitution as a system of oppression, and sex-positive feminists support the reversal of prostitution as a criminal offense, in their wider pursuit of removing any stigmas attached to female sexuality or sex workers as a whole (Comte 197-201). The term is also used here to avoid possible stigmas attached to the use of the term, Finally, although some radical feminists would seek to abolish prostitution, viewing it as subordinating and exerting control over women, it is essentially a practice that allows women to express their sexual autonomy, while reclaiming female sexuality as a whole. For this, among other reasons, it is a profession that rather than being abolished, should be treated like any other. The philosophical positions of radical feminists in opposition to the practice of prostitution can be succinctly summarized in certain key arguments. Essentially, radical feminists posit that when sex workers engage in prostitution, they are not simply offering sexual services in exchange for payment, but rather they are putting a price to their own degradation (Anderson 752). From a radical feminist perspective, requiring women to temporarily fix as an object [of sexual prostitution permanently, completely and literally extinguishes as a (Davidson 92). Additionally, radical feminism is often oriented towards a Marxist interpretation of prostitution as a social system, as radical feminists position prostitution as an institution indicative of the economic and/or social inequalities that they believe to be inherent between the relationship of a sex worker to their potential client(s). Furthermore, instead of simply representing a relationship that is unequal in social power, or Student 3 societal agency, radical feminists recognize prostitution as having been instrumental in creating and sustaining these marked inequalities in the first place (Anderson 752). Judith Walkowitz, a feminist historian that has been active in the feminist movement since at least the period of second-wave feminism, also notes that prostitution has aroused suspicion from radical feminists from the late 1970s onward, as they believed that it resulted in the commodification of the sexual experience. During this period of the sexual revolution, feminists and particularly radical feminists were working to actively liberate and equalize the sexual experience, and especially female sexuality (Walkowitz 189-191). However, a considerable amount of radical feminist argumentation against prostitution will prove to have been biased in its one-sidedness. Some of the most crucial factors influencing, or rather excluding those sex workers that would align themselves with a sex-positive feminist interpretation of their profession, are both misrepresentation and underrepresentation. Historically, public events hosting discussions between feminists and sex workers have been ongoing since at least the 1980s, when an event known as the World Whores took place in Ontario, Canada, in 1986. At this event, sex workers publicly scrutinized feminists, and especially those feminists that would have most notably aligned themselves against prostitution in line with radical feminist perspectives, as having analyzed the sex points of view without having consulted them first about their own personal experiences. At the time, those sex workers chose not to identify themselves personally as feminists on account of their experiences being explicitly overlooked, although they with feminist values such as independence, financial autonomy, sexual self-determination, personal strength, and female (Kesler 220). Student 4 In continuing to fight for both recognition and equal representation, certain feminists who are situated in theoretical orientation closest to radical feminists have been criticized by sex-positive feminists for misleadingly arguing against so-called prostitution. In focusing their efforts on condemning street prostitution as a general practice, radical feminists have committed the fallacy of hasty generalization through applying their analysis of street prostitution to prostitution as a whole, in its full capacity as a profession. Street prostitution cannot be adequately critiqued as reflecting the realities of prostitution in its totality, and moreover, those accounts of street prostitution have an overwhelming tendency to emphasize violence and exploitation in their own right. Even if one were to further consider prostitution to be a commodification of the sexual experience, it could still be argued that in order to understand the widespread commodification of sex, one needs to look no further in society than areas such as the advertising industry (Kesler 233). In an anecdotal study conducted in San Francisco where sex workers were interviewed about their profession, it should be noted that safety and as well as ability to build community with other sex were cited by some workers as legitimate reasons for supporting the decriminalization of sex work. A sizable majority, or at least 83 percent of the workers interviewed, also expressed interest in regulated and mandatory health screenings in order to ensure the safest working conditions possible (Lutnick and Cohan 41-43). Though of course a sample cannot be understood as indicative of the entire population of sex workers, it would nevertheless be reasonable to assume that based on the sex workers interviewed in San Francisco, through their bonds of community and strengthening of their own sexual self-determination, sex workers would represent an expression of feminist values (Kesler 220). Student 5 Thus, prostitution as a profession is not only compatible with feminism, but an expression of feminist principles in its own right. By allowing women to reclaim female sexuality and express their own decisions in regard to how they navigate their sexual autonomy, it is a profession that should be treated like any other. Various critiques that radical feminists have applied to it over the years have neither considered the individual experiences of sex workers, nor the realities of the profession in its entire scope, resulting in biased analyses. Through reclaiming their societal agency and sexual autonomy in practicing prostitution, sex workers not only help to destigmatize the practice and female sexuality, but also work to actively refute any possible notions of control over women.
