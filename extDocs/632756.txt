Joyce 1 Shannon Joyce Professor Erika Staiger ENC1102-016 29 January 2017 Project 1: Finding Common Ground Teacher tenure is a policy which prevents teachers being fired due to reasons unrelated to their educational practices. Tenure is earned over numerous successful years in the profession, making it more difficult to fire more experienced teachers, who are often paid more. Teacher tenure guidelines differ from state to state, each with their own guarantees and restrictions. While supporting teacher tenure, the National Council on Teacher Quality ensures that each educator put into the education system is not only effective, but also a positive influence on students and their ability to learn. They do not only advocate for the students, but also guarantee that every teacher has the opportunity to put forth their best effort. As in the case that there is tenure, the teachers are more likely to experiment and improve their teaching styles because they are not as afraid of losing their job Opposed to teacher tenure, The New Teacher Project (TNPT) believes that all injustice and inequality in the education system must be eliminated, to ensure the success. Not only the elimination of these instances, but The New Teacher Project also works to advance the policies practiced in each classroom Teacher Although the National Council on Teacher Quality and The New Teacher Project have opposing ideas on the issue of teacher tenure, both organizations are focused on ensuring that the students may effectively learn. To achieve this, a compromise must be reached. During evaluations, teachers who are not seen as effective would be provided with one year of training and support. This would Joyce 2 benefit both organizations, as the teachers who did not improve after the training would possibly be fired, leaving their positions available to teachers with less experience. The National Council on Teacher Quality shows their stance on the issue at hand, and the research they have conducted to back up their position. This will not only verify their position, but will also show what is important to them regarding teacher tenure, which will be used when developing the compromise between the two stakeholders. In 2008, the National Council on Teacher Quality conducted a report which stated no state has ever been able to create effective guarantees and restrictions, regarding teacher tenure. The New Teacher Project shows the issues that they have with teacher tenure, and how they plan to fix it. By showing the issues they have with the topic, this will make it easier to develop a compromise, as if these recommendations are implemented, they are more likely to agree. The New Teacher Project recommendations include: the tryout period and tie tenure to performance, hearings should be more efficient and focused on interests, and the professional stakes for teachers- but stop tolerating any instances of egregious (Rebalancing Teacher The common ground between these opposing organizations is their goal. Both organizations strive to create an effective learning environment for the students by ensuring their educators practice successful teaching techniques. This similarity is crucial in the development of an operational compromise, that benefits both the National Council on Teacher Quality and The New Teacher Project. The proposed compromise has previously been suggested in California. During evaluations, teachers who are not seen as effective would be provided with one year of training and support. This would benefit both organizations, as the teachers who did not improve after the training would possibly be fired, leaving their positions available to teachers with less experience. The Vergara v. California court case, in which the court the fundamental, Joyce 3 Constitutional right of every student to learn from effective teachers and have an equal opportunity to succeed in v. The goal of this case was to a system good for both teachers and by implementing a reward/punishment system, in which the effective teachers will be kept, while the ineffective teachers will be held accountable v. The compromise reached in this court case will be very beneficial in my essay, as this is a real-life situation, where one can see the consequences, whether positive or negative, and how the students, teachers, and others were affected. The compromise is not exact to the one mentioned in my paper, but it will be helpful to note the areas that must be adjusted in the education system to reach such a compromise. In order for this compromise to work, there must be factors set into place. One, for example, being the occurrence of set guidelines for satisfaction ratings during evaluations, and what makes a educational practices unsatisfactory, rather than satisfactory. Another factor that must be considered is teaching department. To ensure a level playing field for all educators, this compromise would affect each teacher equally, no matter their department or teaching background. Importantly, a timeframe must be set in place for granting tenure. A recommended timeframe that would be able to coexist with the compromise is 18 to 24 months, which would not only give the teacher enough time to get acquainted with their profession, but it would also be little enough time to not poorly affect as many students. Overall, this compromise would ensure an effective teaching environment for both students and teachers. As mentioned before, the National Council on Teacher Quality and The New Teacher Project may have opposing ideas on the issue of teacher tenure, but both organizations are focused on ensuring that the students may effectively learn. To achieve this, the compromise reached includes teachers not seen as effective would be provided with one year of training and support. Joyce 4 Therefore, this agreement would benefit both organizations, as the teachers who did not improve after the training would possibly be fired, leaving their positions available to teachers with less experience. This would not only benefit the organizations, but it would also achieve their goal of creating an effective learning environment for students.
