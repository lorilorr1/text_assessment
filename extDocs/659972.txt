Trent 1 Henry Trent Instructor Gill ENC 1102 26 February 2017 Amnesty International The death penalty has been a long standing practice within the United States, and until recently there has been little to no opposition to its use. However, recently people have begun to question its effectiveness, and whether or not it is beneficial to society. One organization in particular calls for its total abolition, Amnesty International. Amnesty International is an organization devoted to protecting human rights. According to the United Nations Universal declaration of Human Rights, all humans are entitled to life (United Nations Human Rights). Therefore, Amnesty International fundamentally opposes the the death penalty. Amnesty International, uses images to spread awareness of its opposition to capital punishment, and to gain support from the general population. The images created by amnesty international utilize the rhetorical appeals effectively. Both images use pathos well, they use pathos well because pathos appeals to human emotion and Amnesty International take advantage of the fact that humans are empathetic creatures. Both images also appeal to logos, this is done through the fact that they both offer logical reasons why the death penalty should be abolished. Amnesty International, aims to abolish the death penalty, they do this by creating advertisements that appeal to Ethos, Pathos, Logos, and Kairos. The rhetorical appeal ethos is used to show credibility of the organization. This is often achieved by having a celebrity or other influential endorsement in the advertisement. Trent 2 Amnesty International does this by having Archbishop Desmond Tutu in one of the images. Without prior knowledge of who Archbishop Tutu is Amnesty International is given credibility because this means that they have the approval from a religious body. However upon further research one would find out that Desmond Tutu is a human rights activist and Nobel Prize winner (Desmond Tutu). Meaning that he has received the highest honor in the realm of Human rights, further establishing his credibility. Although the first image uses Ethos so well, it is only in the second image in that it has the Amnesty International logo on it and Amnesty International is a world renown human rights organization. Pathos, another rhetorical appeal used by Amnesty International, appeals to pity or sadness. The intention is to make the viewers of the images feel sad for whatever is portrayed in the image. The sense of pity evoked from the image is supposed to make the viewer want to stand up for what is being portrayed in the image. This is a fairly easy appeal to use in the case of being anti death penalty. The first image, uses pathos in the quote from Archbishop Tutu, is no justice in killing in the name of (Tutu). This quote makes the viewer feel pity for those who face the death penalty, and it makes the audience question whether or not capital punishment is actually a form of justice. The second image portrays a group of armed men assembling a gallows, or the structure that people are hanged from. This towering figure strikes in the viewer a sense of pity for whoever faces death by hanging. Pathos works so well in both images because humans are very empathetic towards one another. Therefore when one person faces the death penalty, as humans we feel a strong sense of pity toward that person. Logos is also prevalent in both images, The quote in the first image is a prime example of logos. Tutu states that is no justice in killing in the name of (Tutu), this is a Trent 3 purely logical statement. What Tutu means is that murder is murder, and is never justified, and that murder in the name of justices is still murder. At the bottom of the second image Amnesty International claims that 139 countries have abolished the death penalty, and that only 58 more need to be convinced to follow (Amnesty International). The use of logos in this one is not as explicit as it was in the previous image. The statement is an example of logos because it is a statistic. A statistic is used to logically convince the audience that the death penalty is wrong, and should be abolished. Both images also attempt to convince their audiences that the death penalty has no place in society through the use of Kairos. The rhetorical appeal kairos uses timeliness, for example if an advertisement mentions that an offer is available only for a limited time. It is intended to establish a sense of urgency in the viewer. In the first image kairos is more implied and less explicit as it is in the second image. The first image calls for the immediate abolition of the death penalty. The sooner the death penalty is abolished more human lives will be spared, which is the goal of abolishing the death penalty. As for the second image, the use of kairos is significantly more direct. Again the text at the bottom of the image is evokes kairos. countries have wiped out the death penalty. Only 58 are left to (Amnesty International), the text makes the viewer see how far that the organization has come, and that it is only a matter of time before they have achieved total abolition of the death penalty. Amnesty International is an organization devoted to safeguarding human rights on an international scale. This organization is fundamentally opposed to the death penalty. This is due to the fact that according to the United Nations the death penalty infringes on our most basic human right, the right to life. In order to spread awareness Amnesty International releases Trent 4 advertisements on why the death penalty is bad. The target audience for these images is everyone, more specifically anyone who will do something about the inhumanity of the death penalty. Both images wonderfully use Ethos, Pathos, Logos, and Kairos, to convince their viewers that something needs to be done about the death penalty. Trent 5 Trent 6 Trent 7 Works Cited Admin. Desmond  .
