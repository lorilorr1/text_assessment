Jafri 1 Syed Maisam Jafri TJ Murray ENC 1102 February 26 2017 First Draft Project 2 Imagine joining a game of monopoly after it had already been going on for multiple rounds. The other plays have already established their properties and have passed to collect their money. Starting from so far behind heavily diminishes the chances of doing well in the game. In the same way, minority groups like African Americans and Latin Americans have faced laws and policies which held them back from financial growth. Racial wealth gap is defined as, absolute difference in wealth holdings between the median household among populations grouped by race or ethnicity America is quickly becoming a more and more diverse nation while continuing to remain an unequal one. These inequalities and wealth disparities are a direct result of historic injustices and maintained by policies that fail to remedy the situation. The racial wealth disparity present in the United States is very significant and driven by public policy. Wealth inequality has increased dramatically in the past few decades. Almost half of all the wealth earned since 1986 went to the top 0.1% of American households. The top 1% of Americans own 42% of this wealth. According to SIPP data, in 2011 the median black household had $7,113 in assets, the median Latino household had $8,348 in assets, and the median white family had over $100,000 in assets. As of now, 73% of white families own their homes while only 47% of Latinos and 45% of African Americans own their houses. African American households hold a mere 6% of the wealth owned by white households while Latinos Jafri 2 hold an 8% share. A disturbing piece of information arises from this statistic. For every $1 that an African American family owns, white families own $15.63. For every $1 owned by a Latino family, white families own $13.33. Wealth disparity is a direct effect of federal policies which are geared towards making money for those who already have considerable wealth. The elimination of disparities in homeowner rates would reduce this wealth gap considerably. If policies which benefitted the historically and financially deprived races were implemented successfully so that African Americans and Latinos were as likely as white Americans to own their own houses America would be a changed nation. The median wealth for African Americans and Latinos would grow to $32,113 and $29,213 respectively. This is a shrinkage of 31% for the wealth gap between African Americans and white Americans and a 28% shrinkage of the wealth gap between Latino families and white families.
