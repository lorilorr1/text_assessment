Kirkus 1 David Kirkus Professor TJ Murray Composition II 29 January 2017 Most people choose to believe that being unique is what makes us all human, but do not realize that world peace may be accomplished by simply maintaining stronger similarities with others. This similarity, even though it seems small and lackluster, will utter a significant outcome. The color of home is something that seemingly everyone wishes to remain unique amongst themselves. It is assumed that by painting every home in the United States a different shade of pink, world peace will be achieved within the century. According to a study performed by Yumi Saito and Harue Tada, the effects of colors on the human brain can have a mood altering effect. Many of the volunteers in this experiment, and in prior experiments of the same nature have come to the conclusion that when exposed to certain colors, one will experience a reduction in stress. By having a pink home, an otherwise stressful day at work would turn into a relaxing night at home every day of the week! Everyone would be more positive in general, and in turn there would be fewer criminals and fewer negative encounters. Eventually the President would begin to notice a significant increase in positivity throughout the nation, and would be able to suggest the unification of the nation, and the world by house color to the leaders of other nations. The average person would feel more accomplished, live a stress free life, and would likely live for a longer period of time. With that, the rate at which humans accomplish new things would increase. With the average lifespan Kirkus 2 increasing, the efficiency and productivity of humans by the end of their lives would increase on a great level. More technologic advancements would be made all the time, at an incredible rate. Along with being less stressed overall, people would have a sense of unity within their country because they would share something with every member of the nation. Everyone would remain unique in every other way possible, and would even have the benefit of choosing a unique shade of pink for their home. With this small change in lifestyle can come a better overall environment, and happiness among all people. There would also be present something that everybody has in common, so meeting new people would be much easier since everyone can talk about how awesome their shade of pink is. When it comes to having guests over or giving directions to home, there would no longer be any difficulty in finding the residence because the homeowner can give a detailed description of the shade of the home. The main point in everyone having a pink house is for a better life for everyone. It would allow for so much more ease and would ultimately produce better efficiency than ever seen before by humans. Once everybody has assimilated into owning a pink house, then stage one is complete and everyone can then look to the world leaders for further action. At this point, the nations of the world would all agree to remain more peaceful and to ultimately decrease the amount of future wars. As for the people who will claim that the idea is ridiculous, or that it would never yield such a magnificent result, or the people who simply dislike the color pink, the results have been determined several times over, and the conclusion could be historic if utilized correctly. Sure, it would seem odd for a while, not only having a pink home, but sharing that aspect of life with every other person in the country. It might also seem ineffective for the first few years while Kirkus 3 things have yet to change on a grand scale, but after several years there would be a large increase in positivity. All of these arguments can be made, but at the end of the day, what truly matters is not the color of home, but the unification and synchronization of humanity. Most people would agree that having a pink house is a small price for everyone to pay if the outcome includes world peace down the line. In conclusion, the ownership of a pink house would yield personal results that could allow for a reduction in stress, but more importantly it would yield the increase in change all around the nation, and potentially the world over a long period of time. With a lower crime rate and a lot more time to focus on the bigger picture, issues such as national debt and unemployment, things would start to change for the better in no time.
