Schmitt1 Hayden T. Schmitt Ms. Angelica Aranda ENC 1102-033 5 February 2017 Funding Controversy Between NASA and the US House of Representatives Government budgeting has always been a topic of heated debate. Trends in the way we prefer to distribute taxpayer-contributed money are always changing with parallel changes in the politics and the economy. A recent budgeting conflict has arisen between the United States House of Representatives (the House) and The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The House determines the annual budget that NASA receives, which is sourced from the money collected from American citizens through our taxes. NASA is a government-run, space research and space exploration organization that requires significant amount of money to make progress on its many projects, many of which have changed world with the knowledge they uncover. Both organizations want to bring prosperity to the United States, however their philosophy on how to do that, and the funds available to pursue that goal, differ between the two stakeholders. In order to satisfy both sides, a change in organizational structure is necessary. By removing NASA from the government, and reorganizing it as a private organization, the burden of financial support will be removed from the House, and NASA will be able to seek funds from investors beyond the US government by selling company shares on the stock market. In order to remain invested in space technology, the House can issue funds as it votes to do so through grants to specific projects rather than being forced to distribute an entire budget to NASA. Schmitt2 The US House of Representative is a government organization made up of congressmen and women who represent the interests of their respective states. The people of each state vote in member to the House, and the amount of member per state is proportionate to the population size of the state. The website states representative is elected to a two-year term serving the people of a specific congressional (US House of Representatives). This statement the means representing their wishes before the House. During difficult economic circumstances this often involves cutting the budget of programs deemed unnecessary, or maybe simply that have been allocated more money than is prudent for the time being. NASA is one of the targets that were chosen due to its often-untimely payoff. The work done by NASA does not payback its investment quickly enough for the House to justify the amount they pay into it. While the House has mutual interest in making America prosper, they do not have the same long-term timeline for prosperity that NASA possesses. The National Aeronautics Space Administration, or NASA, is a great pillar of pride in American history. Our greatest boast-able achievements have come from the successes of missions carried out by NASA. They have delivered countless satellites, landed on the moon, and put rovers on mars, all in an effort to find ways to improve the lives of Americans, as well as all humanity. The slogan stated on their website states reach for new heights and reveal the unknown for the benefit of (NASA) It is clear that the goal of their organization is to make the United States and the entire world a better place through the work they do at home and in space, however that work is costly. Devin Henry, a writer for the hill, wrote an article that demonstrates the governments desire to reduce funding, with a bill aimed at reducing climate research funding by 300 million dollars, from a total budget of 2 billion (Henry, The Schmitt3 Hill). So while the root interests of these government organizations are aligned, their philosophies on funding allocation differ greatly. While the House dates back to 1789 (the House), these two organizations have operated with the government together since founding in 1958 (NASA). They have always had a money holder, and money recipient dichotomous relationship. The opinion of the House has shifted with the political and economic spectrum of the country over the years of their relationship. John F. Kennedy famously gave them strong support during his presidency, which motivated the American support and an increase of funding to NASA via the House. Even after the catastrophe of the Challenger mission under the Reagan administration, the program still resumed with relatively unchanging support from Americans. Most recently, mass cuts were instituted to NASA under the Obama administration in order to redirect funding into social welfare programs. William Broad, a writer for the New York Times, wrote that NASA not only endured extreme cuts to its funding, but also had to cut their staffing extensively, causing many personnel to transfer to the private sector companies like SpaceX and Boewing (Broad, New York Times). It is clear that both of these organizations are in need of reorganization in order to mutually move into the future and work together. In order to compromise between the conflicting goals of the US House of Representatives and NASA, a restructuring must occur. NASA must be removed from the government as a government program, and reorganize itself into a private space technology research firm, competing directly with SpaceX. Tim Fernholz, a business analyst and writer for Quartz Media, estimated the value of SpaceX, a private space exploration company, at 11.5 billion dollars (Fernholz, Quartz Media). This serves as case study that a private institution can operate to develop space technology without government funding. While there are other companies that Schmitt4 contribute to space technology, SpaceX and NASA are relatively unique, in that they are less diversified in their company goals than a company like Boewing, working specifically to explore space and use the gifts that that research brings towards bettering mankind. Becoming a private organization benefits them both in various ways. It will save the House budget money since it will no longer be the guarantor of NASA. It will add competition to the space exploration market with the US, which will bolster the economy, which is always a key goal of the House. NASA will be able to gain investors from more diverse sources by selling shares of the company on the stock market. NASA also will no longer be restricted on its projects by the minimal government budget that they are provided. The government can remain invested in space exploration, in order to ensure the will of the hopes for space remain as a part of projects, through government grants, which can net to less cost than that used when NASA was a part of the government infrastructure. The necessary steps to make this sort of transition a reality would be to find a buyer for NASA, which would also provide money flow into the House. With the possibility established, a bill would be written removing NASA from the government control and releasing it to the buyer. Fine print could be added to this bill in order to maintain any secrets that the government may want to keep. After approval of the bill from the house, the buyer can reorganize NASA and use its powerful brand to gain investors and continue previously terminated projects. In order to bring prosperity to America and the world, without destroying the economy in the process, tough budgeting decisions must be made. While the US House of Representatives want to make America flourish, they have to balance the glory of space travel, with the stability of the economy. NASA is an organization fully capable of giving prosperity to Americans, but not under the oversight of the US government. It has been proven that a private space technology Schmitt5 company can be just as successful, if not more successful than a government run one. Therefore, NASA needs to enter the realm of competition in order to grow to its full capabilities. The government is only suffocating their capabilities at this point, so cut them from the government fold, but maintain the government involvement in the furthering of science with allocated grant money. The House and NASA will be far more affective with the government tie severed, and voter scientific interested funded in the form of grants rather than total budgetary control.
