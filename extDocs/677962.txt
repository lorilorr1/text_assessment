Alejandra Rincon Professor Roth ENC 1101 Animal Testing Animal testing started around the nineteenth century and till this day it is something that scientist are still using. The use of animal testing is very cruel and something that should have been banned. With the society we live today and all the advanced technology there are other ways that the scientist can go about testing their chemicals instead of using it on animals. By using this method this can avoid many things that come with animal testing such as one of the biggest concerns that not only is it harming the animals but also the humans due to the fact that it always work. http://animal-testing.procon.org/ http://www.aboutanimaltesting.co.uk/animal-testing-timeline.html https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4594046/ Animal testing by MacClellan, Joel P Source Salem Press Encyclopedia, January, 2016. http://naturewatch.org/Campaign/Cruelty-free-shopping?gclid=COrTu9z0lNICFYk6gQodoEEJWQ https://www.downtoearth.org/innocent-animals/animal-testing/cruelty-lab-animal-testing http://blog.humanesociety.org/wayne/2015/09/testing-on-chimpanzees-ends.html
