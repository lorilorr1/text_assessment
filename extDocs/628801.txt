1 Ashley Brooke Shelton ENC 1102 02/02/17 Women in Combat Positions Ever since the dawn of modern society, the issue of gender equality has been discussed, fought over, marched for, and protested. With the help of these and many other often elaborate demonstrations, the rights of women have drastically evolved since the conversation began. (Insert examples here); but is there a point at which a line can be drawn? In recent years, there has been discussion over whether or not women in the military should be permitted to serve in combat roles, a historically male position. Two organizations that can be identified as stakeholders on this issue are the Center for Military Readiness (CMR) and the Service Action Network (SWAN). The CMR is Independent Public Policy Organization Specializing in Military/Social and holds the position that women should not be placed in ground combat positions because the differences that exist between men and women as set by nature would lower the overall standard of the military. The SWAN, on the other hand, is voice of women and the that states its belief that most effective military is one where women are integrated into all These two groups, clearly in opposition of one another, each have strong beliefs on this issue and accompanying evidence to back up those beliefs, however, in order to move forward from this conflict, a compromise between the two is needed. 2 Founded in 1993, the Center for Military Readiness is independent, nonpartisan public policy organization that specializes in military/social (CITATION HERE). According to their website, their mission statement is as follows: The Center for Military Readiness is an independent, non-partisan, public policy organization with a unique mission. CMR promotes high standards and sound priorities in the making of military personnel policies, and takes the lead in defending elements of military culture that are essential for morale and readiness in the All-Volunteer Force. Elaine Donnelly, President of the CMR is well known for her publication of several articles regarding issues surrounding military personnel. Over the years, the CMR has published several articles on their website that shows their outspoken opposition to women being placed in ground combat roles. This opposition, they say, is grounded in research and numerous studies that show that the physiological differences that exist between men and women are enough to lower to overall standard of the United States Military. The CMR seems to be set on their decision but further conversation on this issue and the possibility of a compromise is always in the best interest of everyone involved. In contrast to the Center for Military Readiness, an organization that happens to be in support of this issue is the Service Action Network, or SWAN for short. SWAN was founded in 2007 and claims to be voice of all military women past, present, and (CITATION HERE). As stated on their website, their mission statement is as follows: Our mission is to be the most influential and effective network of service women, acting as their champion, advocate and best information resource: Celebrating the strength, abilities and accomplishments of the fastest growing segment of the US 3 military; Utilizing people, knowledge and influence to eliminate obstacles and drive change; Facilitating progress through research, education, mentorship and outreach; Fighting for service rights today, paving the way for their growth tomorrow position on the issue of allowing women to be integrated into ground combat positions is no secret. From one look at the section of their website titled it is evident that they are all for it. date, SWAN has played a major role in shaping the outcome of many important issues effecting women in the service including opening all military jobs to service women . . the section reads, . . But our work has only just The Service Action Network holds a firm position in their belief for gender equality in all military roles, however, a compromise and further conversation on the topic with an opposing stakeholder might lead to a solution that works for both parties. In all of my research, I cannot find any history of the Service Action Network and the Center for Military Readiness working together or attempting to work together. There is no evidence of any compromise being attempted. On the issue of women being allowed to be placed in military combat positions, the two stakeholders mentioned above are hard set against each other. If the two organizations were to attempt to reach a compromise, such compromise could be reached on the grounds that both organizations simply want what is best for the US military and all of the people who are a part of it, and what will result in our highest rate of success. The compromise that I propose for this issue is that women be allowed to participate and serve in the combat positions as long as they can pass a series of complete and standardized examinations of their capabilities and limitations. These examinations would be developed by 4 the US Military and every individual who desires to serve in such a position such as a ground combat unit would have to participate in the series, whether they are male or female. The tests would be distributed to all interested individuals several months in advance. This compromise would satisfy both parties involved. The opposition of this issue holds its position because of the apparent differences in a man and a physical and mental capabilities, allegedly due to nature (implying that nothing can be done to change it), but by passing this test, a woman can prove that she is capable of consistently performing at or above the level of any of her male counterparts. In conclusion, Women being placed in combat positions in the US military is an issue that many people have been discussing. The two stakeholders mentioned above, the Center for Military Readiness, and the Service Action Network, both make very valid points in their justification for their position, however the compromise that I have proposed could, if implemented, serve as a bridge between the two organizations and their beliefs, as well as the beginning of a new higher standard for all military personnel. 5 Works Cited News & Commentary - Center for Military  News & Commentary - Center for Military Readiness.
