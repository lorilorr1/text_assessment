This paper will touch on many reason why Instagram should monitor what people post, how celebrities being correct role models, and the outcome of those thing with young woman in this world today. Instagram should put a stop to how they let celebrities and people in the spotlight portray themselves, because it is not a true view on reality , young woman are getting depressed, and young woman are very insecure. The two stakeholders in this are Instagram the company and the Dove Real Beauty campaign. Lets first start out with instagram. Instagram is a free online photo sharing and social network platform that was acquired by Facebook in 2012. Instagram allows members users to upload, edit and share photos with other members through the Instagram website, email, and social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Foursquare and What is ?)

Brands and companies use Instagram to market and promote. A lot of people also use it to promote their music. But there are some more fun uses for it. Friends use it to post their friends, and girlfriends/boyfriends, and even family. Instagram has so many positive uses. But things could definitely be monitored more. I do feel pressured to appear a certain way. I would hate for people to think: looks totally different in But I would never edit anything to make it not look like me. I definitely feel that I have to look as good when I go somewhere as I do on Instagram. I feel more pressure in real This is a quote from Lindsay Correia in Young Woman on Instagram and self esteem article written by Mahita Gajanan. This is one of thousands of girls who feel this way being on social media. Celebrities portray themselves as looking so perfect and having everything together on their instagram profile, when in reality its not like that. impossible for it to be like that. Not only do celebrities do this but normal people who are just considered instagram famous do this as well. As many rules as Instagram has, it should be against the rules to Photoshop pictures and post multiple pictures showing off your body. Kylie Jenner is the perfect examle of faking it for the  She cleatly has work done and she just continues to post provocative photos of her body and face making her admirers believe that is what they are supposed to look like. Young woman get insecure and depressed by looking at things like that. Moving along to the Dove Real Beauty campaign. The Dove Real Beauty campaign is a campaign for young girls and young woman celebrate and embrace the bodies they were given and to feel confident and comfortable in the skin they are in. This was created in 2004 by Ogilvy & Mather. Ogilvy & Mather is an advertising company in New York, but started in London. Doves motto is, We believe beauty should be a source of confidence, and not anxiety. why we are here to help women everywhere develop a positive relationship with the way they look, helping them raise their self-esteem and realize their full  (Our Vision) This campaign today is featured on billboards, videos, commercials, and more. To get the real beauty to come out they interviewed many woman of different backgrounds and diversity. There are so many positive things that come out of the Dove real beauty campaign. For whoever joining this movement they will start to feel less insecure and more special about themselves. Although not all about physical looks this gives them the confidence they need to get through life with one less worry. The unrealistic images of what real beauty is can be ignored in this campaign. This campaign has gotten positive feedback from many talk shows such as Good Morning America, The Ellen Show, and The View. The models that are featured in the campaign on commercials and Ads got to do interviews on these different shows. Nancy Etcoff, is a Harvard psychologist , and she examined the campaign today and discovered women have described beauty so differently. So this campaign has boosted young confidence since 2003. But the social media and beauty has changed a lot since 2003. These two stakeholders are Instagram and The Dove Real Beauty campaign. Instagram sends a whole different message than Dove does. Instagram allows people to show their bodies and unrealistic self to the world and their followers. The Dove campaign is created to get away from things like that. The way some celebrities and people in the limelight use their social media can be fake. Photoshop is so apparent on instagram and the campaign tried to get away from all of that. The Dove campaign has to work extra work these day just because times have changed and social media has become much more popular. Everyone bases things off of social media today. Instagram and The Dove Real Beauty campaign can work together on these problems. Instagram can propose to all of the celebrities and popular people to join this campaign movement. They could put a stop to the use of Photoshop, and filters, and edits. If young woman see the people they admire on social media promoting and fighting for the Real Beauty campaign they will start to feel better about themselves. They will start to realize the unrealistic body type, hair, and face shapes are in the past. Young woman look up to these celebrities and look to instagram as an escape and somewhere to build confidence. If one get the liked he or she think they should have, they think they are ugly or not good enough. They began to think the woman they are admiring get all of that attention, something must be wrong with them, when not the case at all. Something that The Dove campaign could try to change about their program is to make it more about personality as well. The fact they focus solely on physical beauty could be seen as negative to some people who done see that as important. In conclusion, the way that celebrities carry themselves on social medias sites such as Instagram is doing more negative than positive in this generation today. The Dove Real Beauty campaign can be a start for the celebrities to join in on, and everyone in some sort of limelight to start promoting. These two stakeholders are at odd with each other but have an easy solution. Working together would benefit both of these companies. Instagram could receive more ratings and money for getting people on  to join in. The Dove campaign could get more followers and funding for the campaign. All for the young woman of the world to be happy and feel better about themselves.
