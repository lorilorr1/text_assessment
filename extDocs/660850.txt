Mara 1 Axhens Mara Maria Theodosiou ENC 1102 26 February 2017 Gun control vs Gun ownership Gun control has been a hot debate topic lately regarding to its mission, partly restricting the gun ownership right, a right supported by the Second Amendment. When the Second Amendment was written, the right to bear arms was guaranteed to everybody, representing the right of people to defend themselves and their families (Second Amendment). Yet throughout the years there have been some change in that concept, leading the recent situation where gun violence is increasing (Beckett). Therefore, organizations like VPC are working on finding new methods that would lead to a decrease of that phenomenon. VPC is a non-profit organization formed by a group of people with the aim to reduce the number of deaths caused by gun violence. Since it was founded back in 1988 the Violence Policy Center has been contributing on the issue of gun control leading to major results that represent a decrease in the number of lives taken by gun violence (VPC). The methods used by Violence Policy Center are based on research and education, implemented in the form of new laws regarding gun rights and campaigns raising public awareness on the issue. Seen from the perspective of pro-gun organizations, Violence Policy Center is considered as an organization that aims to restrict the right of people to own a gun, leading to a furious debate regarding mission. Regardless of the debate, as VPC states, the aim of such regulations is to provide a safe environment for the community, this being the reason of the Second Amendment regarding gun rights. Mara 2 The first picture is aiming on making the audience reflect on the way we are treating the gun control case by providing the contrast between the way two different objects are treated regarding public safety. Comparing Teddy Bears with guns on the context of product safety gives an understanding of how pathetic and underestimated the situation is. Judging from the shocking statistic, the fact that such a worrying situation is left without proper control and regulations is worrying and confusing. Minor problems were spotted on the Teddy Bear product analyze and action was taken decades ago. Yet, guns are related to so many accidents that lead to thousands of tragic results, yet no action has been taken yet regarding this issue. Through the comparison of the lethality of these two products, the image wants the audience to reflect on the recent situation and the actions taken regarding gun issue, answering their concern and confusion with the solution provided at the bottom of the page that would fix this problem. The picture relies mainly on logic. Ethos is implemented by providing references to credible sources regarding the case (Hoffman). This is achieved by displaying facts and statistics from United States Consumers Product Safety, which plays the role of a credible authority for this case. Analyzing deeper aspects of the image, elements of pathos are found on the contrast formed between the Teddy Bear and guns. Such illogical comparison combined with the intriguing facts, leads the audience to reflect over the lack of attention paid regarding the worrying situation. As stated above, the whole images based on facts and statistic, providing the audience with the information needed to logically judge the situation. After informing the audience regarding the situation, the image also pushes them to take action by implementing elements of Kairos by stating that action over the Teddy Bear case was taken decades ago yet, nothing happened regarding the gun case which was followed by all these deaths. In addition to all this elements logical fallacies were also used. When offering a solution, the intentions of Mara 3 are represented as deadly in this image, putting all the fault for the tragic consequences on them. By combining all this elements, the image successfully manages to deliver the message that action should be taken regarding the case. The second image tries to deliver a message that gun ownership and gun right are responsible of thousands of deaths, despite their original aim to provide safety in the form of self- defense.According to studies, 33,000 people die in United States every year from gun violence (Everytownresearch.com) The situation reflected by the image should make the audience realize over the real impact that such rights are having in the society and pushes them to reflect over the logical solution to this problem. This is intended to be achieved by providing statistics that contrast the real reason why gun ownership rights are guaranteed to people. Using the effect formed from color gradients and size scales, the image aims to raise awareness of the audience over the immediate need for change, pushing the audience to act quickly over the case and support gun control laws, which is what VPC stands for. The image mainly consists of statistics and facts providing a needed environment to react logically over the situation. When displaying the statistics, it is mentioned that the study was conducted by Violence Policy Center. In this situation, VPC is treated as an authority, being a big organization that has made numerous contributions regarding gun control, making it a credible source in this case. This is an element of ethos, providing credibility to the image. The image also provides a saying on top, describing the reason behind all this deaths, letting the audience understand that the benefits to this issue are not worth the consequences. Logos is present throughout the whole image by the use of statistics. But, when analyzing deeper, the size comparison of the numbers resembles a scale that gets bigger and bigger. This element, combined with the change in the color gradient resulting in a blood red color and the orientation Mara 4 of the guns pointed at the biggest number representing the number of suicides, aims to make the audience feel that the situation is getting more serious, thus immediate action should be taken. These elements combined are a form of implementation. Logical fallacies are also present here. The saying on top gives the idea that all these deaths are the result of guns issued based on gun rights even though most of the crimes happen with weapons provided illegally, thus a is implemented (Hoffman). Overall, the image manages to deliver the message that the benefits from gun right come with a lot of consequences thus we have to action is required to change the situation. All in all, both images successfully manage to deliver the message. The inform the audience over the situation and help them decide the best solution by providing information directly related to the case. Furthermore, in the first image, a solution is also provided, making it easier for the audience to realize what they need to do to change the situation for better. Both images implemented numerous elements regarding rhetorical appeals and were creatively designed to affect the audience to reflect and take action. Hopefully, the situation will improve over the years, resulting on a safer environment for everyone. Mara 5 Mara 6 Mara 7 Works Cited Beckett, Lois, Aliza Aufrichtig, and Kenan Davis.
