Calvin Crino Emil Smith First Year Composition 4/2/17 The Importance of Accessibility in Public Transport In this modern age there is an acclaimed progress, a goal of unity and inclusion where all people have equal opportunity; However this goal has not been achieved. Those with disability be it physical, or mental are not allotted the same accessibility to public resources and are therefore excluded from this progress. Accessibility is important and often overlooked, however in order for total inclusion to be achieved it must be the guiding light for public transport design despite the possible costs. In a democratic system every person is able to weigh in on what they think is right or wrong, together many determine how the world aught be. Now consider if, as many other groups, those with disabilities were unable to vote. This emulates the breadth of inaccessibility. For example everyone can use a public library but not everyone can get to that same library. If public transport does not provide for those with disability it essentially makes all public services discriminative to those with disability. Given how much society as a whole has fought discrimination, allowing those with disability to be ignored counters the human rights society holds dear. Therefore accessibility is a must in order for human rights to be upheld. Exclusion is result of both active separation as well as unconscious design decisions, that defines society. The exclusion of a person, no matter the reason, will socially stigmatize them. As is the nature of psychology the very act of physically distancing two people will make them like each Crino 2 other less. Considering this, the inadvertent exclusion that separates those with disability from those without makes the division perceivable as well as creating mental divisions. Therefore in order to maintain the ideal of unity it is necessary that exclusion particularly the inadvertent kind be prevented through equal access and ease of use for everyone. The problem is that the plight of those with disabilities is known by most people, it also is not often thought about. Despite almost one fifth of americans having disabilities the average person is unaware of the because they are without disability(US Census Bureau Public Information Office, 2016). Because of this miss-proportionally perspective the importance of accessibility is greatly diminished in the eyes of the average citizen. However this does not mean that accessibility is not important, in fact i means that it is more important that it is given credit for. If accessibility was fully implemented the awareness of the average person would increase promoting the ideal of unity. The final argument against increased accessibility is the cost of the proposed changes to public transport. The fact of the matter is that there are many places where accessible public transport is nearly non existent and therefore the changes required to achieve total accessibility would cost multiples of the current systems cost. However despite the proposed cost of implementation the cost of non implementation is greater. Every person whose economic potential is hindered by inaccessibility due to disability costs society, the total of which is greater than the cost to implement the semi specialized systems, like ramps and signage, into public transport to create accessibility. Therefore it can be concluded that the importance of accessibility greatly outweighs the costs associated with its implementation. As well as that the social importance of accessibility more greatly affects the populace then is acceptable to ignore. Crino 3 Work Cited Ahmad, M. (2015).
