Amanda N. Brown Cat Modlin-Jackson ENC 1101 04/07/2017. Social Media Addiction in Teenagers Social media has a great impact on a emotional performance because it is linked to various psychiatric and psychological disorders, self-esteem and self- confidence levels, their ability to socialize (in real life) and affects the way they feel about stepping out of their comfort zone. To fully understand why social media can have such negative impacts on life, it is important to know what social media really is. As far as we are concerned, social media is the different sites and databases used to communicate and interact with people all around the world. It is said that social media does not create problems such as: sleep deprivation, low self-esteem, psychiatric symptoms in some and depression seen in some psychiatric and psychological development; it only adds more problems to the issue. In certain aspects, this is not entirely true. A study was made using both social media users and non-users. Based on the results, they saw that teens addicted with social media were diagnosed with several issues and low self-esteem. On the other hand, teens that used no social media appeared to have no problems regarding their self-love and self-confidence. They had an easier way of approaching people and actually starting a conversation compared to social media users. Some started depending on what others said, how much likes they got and how many followers they got and would only post stuff based on what they thought what others would like. This is due to the fact that social media is seen as a strong influence of a response to how they act around people out of their virtual life et al- 2011). There are different criteria found on social media addiction, such as: preoccupation, uncontrolled impulse, usage more than intended, tolerance, withdrawal, impairment of control, excessive time and effort spent on the Internet, and impairment of decision-making ability. Teens who battle with social media addiction sometimes struggle with depression and are not able to endure family and personal relationships. Every addiction is subsequently linked to whatever psychiatric disorder is shown and how a teen grows up (his/her environment). To further support this theory, a set of questions and psychological tests were performed to kids with divorced parents showing as a result that indeed a missing paternal/maternal figure has a lot to do with social media uses. teenagers with social media addiction have more severe psychiatric symptoms that those who show less interest in them. Facebook and Twitter are somewhat seen as ways of coping mechanism and without proper supervision or lookout for psychiatric symptoms, these social medias eventually lead to an addiction to them. internet addiction changes a perception on things and effects it has on their self-esteem. It said that although blogs sometimes seem to help to help teenagers at all, it in fact, helps health professionals such as psychologists understand better their patients and giving them an window to their social media is seen as a way to escape from ourselves and create a said that seems much more appealing that the real life (Weinstein 2010). Even though social media platforms are said to be beneficial, they can be harmful as well. Over the course of recent years, social media has been a rather harsh subject of discussion for a lot people debating on whether it is safe for children. There have been cases in which social media has had fatal results on families due to the rather disturbing impact on teenagers. You see, social media for as long as I can tell has always been used to criticize teenagers (positively or negatively). Such comments or posts about someone can lead to a person believing he or she is not good enough and may lead to suicidal behavior and thoughts. Overall, teenagers fall into that pit in which they find comfortable with themselves and they eventually resort to thinking they are the problem, which is reality they are not. As to speak, living your life depending on social media will make you lack that emotional connection you should have when physically interacting with others. In other words, decreases the face-to-face communication skills. As to why social media has a big impact on teens and how it can become something dangerous for some, I think it all comes down to how each of us take things that are said to us and how we process them. Not all teens are affected by comments, posts and pictures they see on the internet. Although almost every teen in our generation has access to social media some seem non-interested on these platforms. Matter of fact, it is known that social media is a way to create someone different to your real-life person and kind of live through that and invent someone you would never dare to be in front of others. So, in conclusion, not everyone is affected by the hideous social standards of expectations different people have based on different brain-washed criteria and for some social media is the main cause for psychiatric disorders and other issues. It is important for parents and others to be pending and aware of what their tweens and teens are up to these days when it comes to social media. Because social media can have magnitude of troubles psychologically, psychiatric an emotionally speaking, it has to be treated as serious as if it were a substance abuse problem; both often leading to suicide.
