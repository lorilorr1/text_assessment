Sanson 1 Jacqueline Sanson Erika Staiger Composition II 16 April 2017 The Welfare of Market Animals A market animal is any animal raised for the production of a product people use which includes meat, eggs, and milk. In recent times the demand for animal products has increased in the United States and consumption is at its highest (Pluhar 456). This has led to what is known as factory farming. Factory farming is an efficient and profitable way to produce animal products by using practices like keeping animals in highly confining areas, and force feeding them. This now popular practice in farming has many downfalls including the health of employees, the environment and animals (Plurah 457). In particular, the animals that must spend their whole lives in these conditions are greatly abused by the system. More worrisome is that farm animals, which are most often used as market animals, are completely left out of the Animal Welfare Act and therefore have no protection under the law. In order to create change USF students should begin to purchase only products that use animals treated humanely as well as signing a petition to amend the Animal Welfare Act to include market animals. Market animals in the United States during current times live in highly cramped areas, provided very little stimuli throughout their entire life, exposed to rampant disease, and often times must experience stressful events. Although practices very between species and farms, animal welfare is often very low. The wellbeing of these animals can be determined by the frequency of normal behaviors they exhibit. When it comes to chickens raised for meat, called broilers, the Animal Welfare chair Shana Bergmann states that, should have the Sanson 2 possibility to run freely, peck, scratch, flap their wings, groom their plumage and rest and sleep In a study conducted on broiler chickens it was seen that behaviors like locomotion and foraging were seen less in groups of broiler chickens that were raised in a conventional manner than the chickens that were less crowded and given perches and straw (Bergmann et al 22). The chickens in the first group exhibited less healthy behaviors then the second, which shows that the conventional manner of raising broiler chickens can have a negative effect on the wellbeing of the individual broiler chickens. Animals are often mutilated in order to reduce the effects of unhealthy behaviors. Nordquist of the Behavior and Welfare group states, procedures . . . were introduced to counteract problems that emerged when livestock farming became intensified, such as tail docking in fattening pigs in response to tail Not only are these animals in living conditions that are not optimal, they must suffer procedures that mutilate their bodies in order to keep factory farming productive. Many other practices also raise concerns for animal welfare. These include the early separation of calves from their mothers, gestation crates for nursing pigs that severely limit mobility, the restriction of water for pigs, increased disease, and individual housing for social animals (Nordquist et al 7). Regardless of how mistreated a market animal is, they are not protected by law. The Animal Welfare Act specifically excludes farm animals from the protection of its guidelines. Therefore the people in charge of market animal operations have no reason to improve conditions for these animals if it is not profitable. The welfare of market animals should be a moral concern to those who use animal products. The use of animals in many fields is often justified on the belief that animals are not sentient beings as humans are. Proctor from World Society for the Protection of Animals notes emotional experience of humans is both a personal experience and subject to false Sanson 3 reporting. We do not deny that humans are sentient because of this, but many do question animal sentience on the same Although there may not be proof for animal sentience we still have reason to believe that they feel similar emotional states as us. Therefore, market animals should be given higher quality of life in order to eliminate suffering. One way these quality of life should be bettered is improving their health. The extent of current conditions can be summarized when Plurah a professor of philosophy at Pennsylvania State University brings to light, Pollan recounts being asked to don a biohazard suit before visiting a brooder Disease intensified by factory farming is especially concerning because not only does it effects market animals but also humans. The consumption of contaminated animal products and the wide spread use of antibiotics, which help create antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria, are both problems created by intensive farming practices (Plurah 456). The problems caused by current farming practices are far reaching and must be addressed. Although the problem may be too large for one person to change, USF students can take steps to improve the welfare of animals. One way USF students can do their part is by only purchasing animal products that use animals treated humanely. The use of labels that indicate free range or organic ensure that the animals were at least raised with excess to pasture land (Heerwagen et al 73). The purchase of these kinds of products make it more profitable for animals to be raised with higher welfare practices. According to Heerwagen from the Journal of Agriculture and Environmental Ethics, welfare legislation have turned interest towards market-based improvements in animal Therefore consumers have the power to better the welfare of market animals by changing what is profitable, in this case better animal welfare. Another way that animal welfare for market animals can be increased is by amending the Animal Welfare Act which currently excludes farm animals. This means that market animals are Sanson 4 currently not protected by the law. USF students can amend the Animal Welfare Act by creating a petition. If a petition reaches 100,000 signatures it can be considered by congress and potential create a new law. USF students have the ability to change the treatment of market animals whether it be by buying products with higher welfare standards, signing a petition or by other ways. The current state of market animal welfare is very disheartening. Animals must live in conditions that are not natural, causing stress and unhealthy behaviors. These animals are also subjected to cruel practices like mutilation in order for the animals to be more profitable. This should be a concern to USF students that use animal products. The conditions that these animals must face cause these animals sever discomfort and raises the question that current uses of market animals may not be ethical. Therefore the conditions these animals live in need to be improved. USF students can take part in this change by buying products that promote better animal welfare and signing a petition to amend the Animal Welfare act.
