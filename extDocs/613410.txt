The ultimate goal for the stakeholder is to be able to hinder food waste while still being able to create jobs, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, and alleviate hunger, as well as save water and other resources. targeted audience consist of environmental activists and anyone else who cares about the excess food that is being wasted every day. In order to persuade their audience, their messages and images on their website contains materials that cause the audience to emit emotions. On top of that, it will also cause the audience to think and reason with the call to action due to their credibility and authority in the field. For example, on website, an image of a healthy green lettuce is visible as soon as the website is accessed. This image immediately catches the attention as its vibrant colors of green that slowly fades to violet captures their eyes. The use of this color is way of appealing to the emotions as the color green is known to emit feelings of good health and harmony as it is also the color of life. The fading of the green to the violet also appeals to emotion as violet is to symbolize the imagination and dreams for the future. These two colors come in unity as both can be achieved by the reduction of food waste. There is also a text joining the image that states we can reduce U.S. food waste by 50% by which also Last Name 3 hits pathos as using the pronoun allows the audience to feel like they are actually doing it together and that it is not only the organizations work, it is also each individuals. This makes the audience feel important to the cause. On another note, there is a message embedded in the image that appears as data- driven guide for businesses, government, funders, and nonprofits to collectively reduce food waste at This embedded text definitely appeals to ethos, which is the appeal to credibility and authority, as ReFED basically states that their targeted audience is much larger than just humans who care about the excess waste of food and this implies that they have worked with larger authorities. An image located in the tab of the website is filled with visual rhetoric as the stakeholder is trying to use it to attract the targeted audience. The image consists of food such as carrots, peas, and pickles that are in an enclosed jar that appears to be hand packed considering the lid of the jar is composed of a piece of cloth that is being held together by a rope. The message that this image is trying to convey is that food that is in excess or unwanted can be saved in tightly packed jars either for a later time or to be distributed to those who need it. On top of that, the jar is made out of household items that people can find lying around and the purpose for that is to show that people do not have to go to big organizations or companies in order to do the same and that they can help reduce food waste by packing excess food in easily accessible household items. With this image, there are many areas where it appeals to logos, ethos, pathos, and Kairos. The appeal of logos is used in this image as it is logical to pack foods using items that are easily accessible and convenient for the audience. It does not make sense to have to have someone else like a manufacturer or a big organization to do it for them. It is also more logical to Last Name 4 store food for whenever the audience may want it at a later time or to distribute to those that need it, instead of throwing it away. As for ethos, the stakeholder in the image has been in the business for more than 30 years. It is also a nonprofit organization so in addition, it helps their credibility while giving the audience a peace of mind that they are not a money hungry company that is based upon monopolies and they do not have to worry about them taking their money as well. As for pathos, the image is orange themed and it seems to have an orange tint with the carrots and peppers. The color orange is usually associated with emitting feelings of joy or warmth, and it also represents good health. Kairos can also be found in this image as the jars are sealed and packed in a way that it is time restricted and that it should be either refrigerated or distributed right away. Another image under the tab can be found which consists of an employee checking the organized produce in a grocery store. The message that this image is trying to convey is that the use of organized shelves in stores can impact food waste as the food that expires first is oriented in a way where it will get picked sooner than the ones that will expire at a later time. This method will reduce the amount of food wasted. The stakeholder uses logos in this image as, as previously stated, it is logical to not waste food. It is also logical to keep the produce on the shelves as healthy as possible to reduce throwing away. Ethos is also present in this image as the person checking the produce is a worker and it shows authority which gives him credibility. As for pathos, this image contains a lot of the color green and the color is known to be associated with the feelings of safety, fertility and environment. As for Kairos, it is present in this image as the whole purpose of the message is to make sure that these green produce stay in Last Name 5 the shelves for the right amount of time and not long after they are expired where they have to be thrown away. In conclusion, stakeholders use these strategies in order to attract their audiences. These are effective as they appeal to most perspectives and that is what companies take into account when they create these images. Last Name 6 Works Cited: Hoffman, Allyson, and Kimber Wiggs.
