Page 1 Jovica Gasic Feb/1/2017 Angelica Aranda EPA versus Exxon: A Resource and Its Hazards Across the globe, Exxon is known as a powerful oil company and oil refinery that seeks to both better itself and its community. Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is a vastly influential government funded organization, whose focus is to better human health and the environment for the future generations to enjoy and retain. It is interesting how different these two stakeholders are, but it is just as interesting how similar some of their goals are. Exxon-Mobil has spent millions of dollars on helping the globe with Malaria and successfully reached more than 124 million and more than 13.5 million bed nets, 2.1 million doses of antimalarial treatments and 2.2 million rapid diagnostic around the world (Exxon-Mobil). The EPA, on the other hand, studies and researches problems occurring in human health and actively petitions changes in government or uses their budget to make massive changes or to fund education over the said problem. Seeing how invested both stakeholders are invested in helping or changing their communities, it is strange to know that the companies are at odds over climate change. The main mission for 2014 through 2018 is to tackle climate change and improve air quality around the world. Unfortunately, Exxon-Mobil does not agree completely with the EPA over climate change because oil refining and selling oil which is their main business. Their main business is also one of the reasons why carbon emissions are still high, and one of the main things that gives oil companies a bad look today. Climate change is a very real problem, one where both parties are needed to help resolve the issue, therefore, revising Page 2 the cap-and-trade system to reduce carbon emissions would be a good way to compromise between the two organizations. The EPA strives to keep human health in the United States and the environment safe for the future generations and so people can live comfortably in the United States. The mission to protect human health and the (EPA) and they have been doing that for decades. However, their toughest job to date is the effect of climate change. In fact, their official strategic plan for the years of 2014 through 2018, lists climate change and improving air as their first goal of this section of the year (EPA). Climate change will have a devastating effect on human health. The future of climate change is bleak, with average Earth temperatures increasing, average snow cover decreasing drastically, sea levels rising, and a gradual deterioration of human health. The EPA warns people that changes will impact our food supply, water resources, infrastructure, ecosystems, and even our own (EPA) And they are not alone in making this warning. An environmental journal called Nature, published an article by Jonathan A. Patz, Diarmid Campbell-Lendrum, Tracey Holloway and Jonathan A. Foley, a team of medical doctors and environmental scientists, pointed out that prevalent human diseases are linked to climate fluctuations, from cardiovascular mortality and respiratory illnesses due to heatwaves, to altered transmission of infectious diseases and malnutrition from crop (Patz Campbell-Lendrum Halloway Foley, page 310). So, changes in temperature can lead to dramatic changes in human health in the United States and the entire world. On the other hand, Exxon-Mobil seem to also care for the environment saying that they are improving environmental performance while pursuing reliable and affordable (Exxon-Mobil). However, means of improving their performance in the Page 3 environment is different from how the EPA would want it to be. As a company, making drastic changes to their economy and attempting to keep up with such drastic changes would mean the end of the company, so their style is more of a slow development in efficiency. Exxon has invested in technology known as and Reach to reduce ecological footprint and their impact on the environment while also continuing to benefit the economy (Exxon-Mobil). A 2013 study by Wendy L Tate, Lisa M. Ellram, and Ismail three prestigious researchers from their respective universities of Miami, Tennessee, and East Anglia, pointed out that Exxon has collaborated with nongovernmental organizations the world for its corporate citizenship activities concerning environmental sustainability. Exxon learns about possible ideas from its arms-length relationships with NGOs that it donates to, and those supported by its (Tate Ellram These nongovernmental organizations have contributed to a large portion of climate research and show that going slowly into the future of the environment may be a more efficient way for companies like Exxon to help the climate change problem that the world is facing. Unfortunately, the EPA and Exxon have a vastly complex problem, yet neither is willing to support the other due to the approach to the problem. As mentioned before, the EPA seeks to better human health and will use governmental powers to help create laws and regulations to get fast results. This presents a problem when considering that reducing Carbon emissions and reducing greenhouse gasses quickly would mean that every company that uses fossil fuels would be negatively affected. Companies like Exxon must relatively quickly find a different market because the United States market would be too difficult to sell fossil fuels to due to stricter laws and regulations. This would not be good for the U.S economy and not good for the people of the United States. However, and way of changing the Page 4 carbon footprint left by the company, may be too slow for the speed of global warming. Coming up with new technologies and implementing them takes several years, even for a company that invests in technology as much as 1.5 billion dollars in growth and efficiency in the past six years as Exxon has (Exxon-Mobil). With the strongest effects of global warming coming within a few decades, it may be smart to speed up the tempo of the fight against climate change. However, this the first time that the EPA has clashed with energy companies over emissions. In the last century, The EPA has created dozens of regulations that energy companies must follow. One of which is the Clean air act. This mainly was to help improve the air quality in highly industrialized areas of the United States. Many large companies did not agree with the fast acting tactics that led to a small economic hurdle for many of these large companies to cross. For example, Exxon and a lot of oil companies of this time, must change the fuel to reduce the lead content in the fuel sold to consumers because the lead would enter the bodies of people and cause damage. Lead was used in gasoline to reduce engine knocking and power failure in engines of early motors. Due to this new act, the oil companies including Exxon had to come up with a new way to treat their fuel to protect motor engines without the use of lead. This cost the companies millions but eventually it was resolved. There may be a solution to the problem of protecting assets and efficiency while dealing with climate change and air quality as fast as possible. As a compromise, using the Cap-and- Trade method as a way of capping the total amount of Carbon Dioxide allowed to be produced by companies like Exxon in one year. This is only a part of the compromise because, compliance to the Cap-and-Trade system would yield allowances to Exxon and other fossil fuel using industries which can help get tax breaks to these industries, avoid penalty on the chance that the company goes over the cap. These allowances can be traded and sold between companies. The Page 5 catch is that unlike the previous cap-and-trade system used to reduce sulfur dioxide in the air, this is going to focus mainly on greenhouse gasses, therefore, providing even more incentives like more tax breaks for furthering technology in the field of capturing an extracting carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels. This satisfies both sides of the argument because the EPA can expect faster results due to collaboration between companies like Exxon and a money based incentive would keep the pace up, while also being slow enough to standards where they can gradually make changes and investments based on where the company needs it. The success from around the world including in the European Union where this type of Cap and Trade system is currently taking place has seen the Carbon emission drop by 15 percent since 2005 (Environmental Defense Fund). These two stakeholders have the potential to work together to create a brighter future for people. This compromise will allow to two to tolerate each other better while also mutually benefiting from the system. The EPA gain what they wanted in that the air quality will continue to grow and it is a relatively cheap solution. Exxon gains public support for cutting down on the amount of Carbon Dioxide produced, but also gain a huge economic advantage which it can use to grow. Hopefully, climate change can be a smooth transition for human health with the help of this compromise and others like it.
