1 Richard Professor Noah Pearlstone ENC 1102 12 March 2017 PETA: Advertisement for the protection of animals The ethical treatment of animals as a topic is one that has been on the controversial side due to how humans often use animals as test subjects for different products or for consumption. According to Animals Australia, companies such as Colgate and Febreze are two of the many companies that regularly test their products on animals before making their way into the market (Animals Australia). NPR has estimated that the United States alone tends to consume about 52.2 billion pounds of meat total on a yearly basis. (NPR). As a result, PETA, an organization that advocates for the ethical treatment of all animals, has openly expressed complete disdain for the terrible treatment that animals have received from humans over the years. goal is to create awareness on the treatment of animals and how boycotting certain companies and converting to veganism can effectively better their treatment in the world. By examining the pro-animal rights message promoted in their images, the specific usage of visual rhetoric allows PETA to appeal to the general public by relying on artistic representations of animal abuse that consist of dark color schemes and alteration of images. Through these form of advertisement, PETA is able to direct the attention and support of its audience towards their pro-animal rights campaign. desire to promote the concept of ethical treatment is reflected on the rhetorical appeals present in images used as advertisement for their organization. On their website, PETA explicitly states that creature with a will to live has a right to live free 2 from pain and As an organization, they believe that rights is not just a is a social movement that challenges traditional view that all nonhuman animals exist solely for human (PETA). By presenting their advertisements in the form of public billboards, and through different forms of social media such as Facebook the organization is able to capture the attention from the general public. Through the use of images, organizations can effectively convey their message towards the targeted audience through the implementation of rhetoric appeals. Two forms of advertisement that have been released by PETA showcase the effective use of pathos and logos to get their message across. Moreover, through their specific usage of rhetorical appeals, PETA is able to simultaneously target the feelings of their audience towards the animals and subsequently lead their audience to have second thoughts about having the consumption of animals. In the first advertisement, PETA utilizes a black and white color scheme throughout the entire image with the goal of creating awareness towards the way companies often treat animals to advance their economic agendas. These artistic choices were taken by PETA to create emphasis on the pain that animals often have to go through for the betterment of human lives. By not making the image fully colored, PETA is able to effectively ignite feelings of sadness for the sheep that was stripped from its wool to make a sweater. In addition, by deliberately leaving the color of the blood as red, the focus of the audience is quickly directed to the sheep as a way for PETA to showcase how much suffering the sheep is in. Furthermore, by implementing the phrase you by this (the sweater), you support this (mistreatment of sheep) PETA is able to convey the message of how there is no ethical way of using animals as a mean to produce clothes for human use. In contrast, the same image would not have been able to effectively create the 3 same feelings of sadness in its audience had it been fully colored as that would make the image deviate from the negative connotation. design choice of implementing the phrase you buy this, you support is able to make their audience believe that it is only logical to think that animals go through extreme forms of pain and suffering during the production of clothes. Furthermore, the phrase support looks slightly bigger to emphasize how there is no other logical way to feel about the usage of animal-based clothing. Logically this appeals to their audience as they can now be aware of what materials were used to buy the clothes they either own or about to buy. In the second advertisement, PETA evokes negative feelings of sadness and pity from its audience by showcasing a turkey that has the face of a sad dog in order to make the general public feel bad about the choice of having meat be a part of their diet. When considering how the United States alone consumes billion pounds of meat (NPR), it goes without saying that millions of animal lives have been ended for the sake of humans. The sad look on the face is meant to make the audience change their mind over eating meat as it makes them think where the line can be drawn in terms of when is it truly acceptable to eat other animals. The rhetorical question you eat your dog, why eat a used on the second image appeals to the reasoning of the general public that has already converted to veganism. The question posed by PETA is meant to make its audience question the logic behind eating meat given how humans are the only species that are able to consciously rationalize what is considered to be right or wrong. This demonstrates that the only way to promote the ethical treatment of animals is to boycott meat industries by converting into veganism. Ultimately, PETA is illustrating that they want their audience to realize that there is no reason to consume other animals and how the act itself is completely unethical. 4 The two selected images illustrate how PETA is able to effectively convey their message through different forms of advertisement. The primary goal behind their advertisement is to promote the ethical treatment by boycotting companies that use animals to make clothes and how veganism is the only way to ethically live among animals. Consequently, PETA strives to show that they believe in the ethical treatment of animals through the use of pathos and logos in their forms of advertisements by targeting the feelings of the general public and subsequently force them to question the logic behind eating other animals.
