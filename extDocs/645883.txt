Intermediate Draft Majed Beirkdar INRTO: Automobiles, we all use them but which type of automobile is the best? In automobile industry, there are three major powered cars. This paper will explain and compare two of these types of vehicles, electric cars and gasoline powered cars. The true creator of the first gasoline powered engine is a highly debated topic. However, many researchers agree that Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot was the creator of the first legitimate automobile. He manufactured two steam-propelled tractors that were made extensively for the transportation of ammunition. The first was created in 1769 and the second was created in 1770 Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot French ). The creation of the first gasoline automobile was truly innovative as it allowed for a much quicker form of transportation than its competitors. As with gasoline cars, the creation of the first electric car cannot be pinpointed to a single individual. In the United States, the first electric car was created by William Morrison sometime around 1890 The History Of The Electric ). To summarize, the creation of the electric and gasoline cars sparked a competition between the two to find the most practical and resourceful car. Even in world, both types of cars are compared and both have their respective pros and cons. The research question is as follows: To what extent are electric cars more practical as compared to gasoline cars? Bibliographic entry #1 Deal III, W. F. (2010). Going Green with Electric Vehicles. Technology & Engineering Teacher, 70(3), 5-11. Electric cars were available a long time ago, as a matter of fact electric cars were dominating the vehicle industry. companies such as Packard, Hupmobile, Hudson, Frazier, Cord, and DeSoto, were the famous electric car manufacturers that everyone bought there cars from. Late 1890s was when the the electric motors companies started to develop electric motors in America, where a company from Philadelphia started to manufacture a fleet of electric-powered taxis for the city of New York. Unfortunately that did not last long, since starting the 1900s brands like Ford, Dodge, and Chrysler started taking over, and you would barley see the electric showrooms or even see them on highways. The article was really useful, and had a lot of good points. I liked how the article was broken down to different parts, like starting with the history, going through the battery technologies, and also explaining the future of what is predicted to happen for both electric, hybrid car, gasoline and petrol powered cars. including advantages and disadvantages to the topic mentioned in the article was a great addition to it, where it gives a great breakdown to the readers to go through the different points and decide what he thinks is better. Overall the article had solid points with great explanations. Bibliographic entry #2 Rudolph, C. (2016). How may incentives for electric cars affect purchase decisions?. Transport Policy, 52113-120. doi:10.1016/j.tranpol.2016.07.014 Electric and hybrid cars, are a step forward to the end of Global Warming, countries around the world are promoting the purchase of hybrid and electric cars. Germany for instants has claimed that the target they are going for is a million cars by there year 2020. Reality speaks, and the numbers at the moment does not show that Germany is getting a million cars on german roads anytime soon. countries around the world are giving privileges too those who purchase a hybrid or a electric car, ranging from free parking spots all over the city to free charging stations. Mathematically proven owing a electric car is way cheaper than owning a petrol or diesel car, in the long run. The article had a lot of statistics, and detailed percentages which i like, because it gives you a great understanding of the points they are trying to deliver. the article also showed solutions and ideas the countries had to to promote the purchase of the electric and hybrid car to start eliminating the global warming issue. Reading this article made me think about getting a hybrid car, because the article uses a great detailed chart that shows you, that by owning a hybrid for electric cars the odds are in your favor.

The history of alternative fuels in transportation: The case of electric and hybrid cars. Utilities Policy, 16(2), 63-71. doi:10.1016/j.jup.2007.11.001 Every one nowadays think that hybrid or electric powered cars are the latest ever or is the newest add to automobiles, but hybrid and electric cars have been there since the history of batteries. Electric cars had a great period which was called the golden age, where electric based cars were popular, that period was from about the 1880 to 1900. Electric cars were also used in war back then; they were usually used to clean the streets and garbage collection. By the 1980s electric cars boomed again and in 1990 California announced their first zero-emission regulations to the public. Fast-forward a couple of years 2001 start of seeing hybrid cars on the road. The article was well organized, and had great detailed historical points. The authors broke down the article to 11 different subtitles that helps the reader by understand the points better. I also like how the academic journal included great quotes. I think this actually helps the reader while trying to get all the different points of the article. The journal started with the history of the electric cars and ended on how nowadays are a lot of different hybrid and fully electric based cars on the roads, and the electric cars transformed from being garbage collectors in the war to being cars that they use day to day.
