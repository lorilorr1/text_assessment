Student 1 Student Professor Thornton ENC 1102 5 March 2017 Complementing takes on the Arts in American Education Throughout the years the arts being integrated on American Education has been a topic of interest and has been recently talked about around the nation. The issue however gives the rise to two different sides and takes on what should be allowed and what should not. the side that questions if arts should be supported in schools everywhere as more than an extracurricular activity. On another note, there are also the ones who believe the arts should not be integrated into education, stating a waste if time and money and should be taken away completely. The Americans for the Arts organization believes and supports the arts while the Heritage Foundation disagrees on the matter and would like it to be removed. The points of view that are taken from the two stakeholders seem immensely incompatible; however, the compromise of keeping the arts in school with a shared funding can be implemented through believing in the importance of the arts as a whole, finding a common ground on both sides, and supporting that one thing that joins them together for the bettering of American society. The Americans for the Arts organization and stakeholder is in full support not only for the arts in school but also for the support of the arts around the entire nation. Their ultimate goal and mission states mission is to serve, advance, and lead the network of organizations and individuals who cultivate, promote, sustain, and support the arts in (americansforthearts.org). They believe in the arts as a form of Student 2 transformation in society and something that should not be ignored or cast aside. On an article written my Randy Cohen on the organizations main page he goes over the top reasons why the arts should be supported. One of the main reasons he states as an example is how the arts improve academic performance, bringing out how students involved in the arts have higher and SAT scores. Also he states how 88% of Americans believe in the arts as an integral part of an all-around successful K-12 education (Cohen 1). Additionally, Cohen as a believer of the arts as the essence for society, also explains how the arts creativity and 1), with 72% of people stating that creativity is of high importance when being hired for a job. These all Other supporters of the arts like Edward C. Warbunton agrees with the Americans for the Arts organization in his article to Arts beyond High School: Issues of Demand and Availability in American Higher on how the art programs have increased performance, reduce absenteeism, develop thinking and social skills, improve (Warbunton 1), and how it also improves connections in the outside world, far away from school. Author Dorothea Lansky also shows her support by stating how the arts bring uncharted opportunities in learning for students. She also argues how it reopens the imagination and with this it brings out change in their society (Lasky 75). These shows how some strongly believe in the arts funding for school education. On the other hand we have the Heritage Foundation, which leads a conservative movement and rigorous conservative policy research to Congress and American (heritage.org). They pursue their mission by timely, Student 3 accurate research on key policy issues and effectively marketing these findings to our primary which mainly include members of congress and policymakers. This particular foundation states that the U.S Congress already struggle to balance the federal budget and that the NEA, or National Endowment of the Arts, should be eliminated from it, stating that the arts have enough support on its own, without federal funding and that its just (heritage.org). Adding up to this, they also state that the arts fail to further improve culture in the United States. They believe that it advocates art that diminishes American values; finally concluding that cutting the NEA be good for the arts and good for (heritage.org) Agreeing with this foundation Kornhaber and Mishook in integration in an Era of go over how student in schools designed to provide a strong arts program are less likely to do good than in a public school with a subservient art program, revealing that too much art integration may be misleading (Kornhaber and Mishook 9). Furthermore, Nicholas Tate from Case against the Arts from Plato to Tolstoy and Its Implications for Why and How the Arts Should Be Taught in goes over the different views on the arts as a negative impact. He states how the arts can corrupt mental judgment, increase emotion over reason, and disturb people from taking care of their lives, which can all be very distracting (Tate 1). Both of them express their dislike of arts in education, therefore accepting what the Heritage Foundation has to offer. When two stakeholders share incompatible goals it may be somewhat hard to find common ground between them. The goals of these two particular stakeholders both go against each other in a lot of different ways. However, they do share one thing in common, and that involves the arts itself. Both sides go to great extents to give people Student 4 reasons as to why supporting the arts can be good for the greater education or how funding for it is just unnecessary and should not be supported. They also share the same concern in common, which is the American people. Both main claims and reasons include people and how these specific claims affect them. Lastly the stakeholders in addition both share the need of getting their voice heard and getting their reasons and missions across. Although one side needs is to get across the importance of the arts in school and the other one completely disagrees it is essentially important for both of them to convey their message in a way that everyone understands them. Solutions for the incompatibility between the how arts in schools should be dealt with have arisen and keep arising as the years go by. Schools all around the United States try to get funding from sponsors around their community in a search for more support in the program and less spending on the governments and respective part. While in some schools it works it fixed the problem as a whole. For a good and successful compromise to be created both of the sides must give up something, bending to the idea. A favorable accord between the stakeholders would be that instead of cutting the whole arts program and budget as a whole, schools could divide the money between a more sustainable department that has more money than they spend and can help as well, like the Athletics department. These proposal benefits the Americans for the Arts organization by still keeping and supporting the arts in school just as their mission strives for. Likewise, it helps the Heritage Foundation through saving the federal budget some money by cutting an amount of money given to the schools. This compromise can be implemented with the help of Congress and the school board of education, where an agreement can be decided that supports the proposal in which both sides are giving Student 5 something away. According to Rajan on the article, the different guidelines to achieving the agreement from the school board include where to find potential funders, writing the proposal, developing a budget, and including an 30). Following this will lead to a possible review and acceptance to this proposed compromise that both stakeholders can cope with. In conclusion, this compromise between those who support and encourage the arts in schools and those who would want it to get unfunded can only be successful if people around America support both sides of it and want to see an accord finally be set between them. This compromise challenges people to think about not only their future but also the future of everyone around them and how it can be affected with this proposal. With this compromise there is hope that on both sides of this ordeal there are those who can see through the clouds of difference and reach an agreement that benefits the American people.
