Muhsen 1 Tameem Muhsen Professor Roth ENC1101.020 5 February 2017 Project 1 Intermediate Draft Drugs have been existent in society since the beginning of time, and law enforcers have comprehended the fact that eliminating drugs permanently is an impossible feat. What can be accomplished however is enforce laws to reduce the distribution and use of drugs. The method in which a country enforces laws to regulate drugs is very crucial as the sake and freedom of many of lives are on the line. Instead of imprisoning drug users and dealers, we should instead provide them with aid such as rehab centers, drug teaching centers, license suspension, probation, at the end of the day, addicts are medical patients and not animals in a cage. Therefore, the strategies, diplomacies, and executive decisions made by the nations must be taken carefully and analytically.

Although the Colombian government states that the range of coca plantations has be condensed, there Muhsen 2 remains to be coca activity but now alongside overwhelming social and environmental consequences. Indigenous populations have been displaced from their grounds and biodiverse regions have been deforested due to this policy. Such analysis proves the failure of the fumigation policy and the ineffectiveness as a strategy in reducing coca farming. Furthermore, this article concludes that what is essentially being eliminated by war on drugs is not coca, but humans and nature. This article was written by Alexander and Giorgos Kallis.
