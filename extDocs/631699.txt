According to the Medical Dictionary, Abortion is the deliberate termination of a pregnancy usually before a fetus is viable. The National Abortion of Federation is an organization that believes women should be free to make decisions that affect their physical health and lives forever. They also believe that it should not be the decision of the government to exclude the option of abortion to pregnant women. The NAF provides facts, statistics, and addresses myths regarding abortion. 1.3 million pregnancies are ended by abortions (Dudley 2003).

The Pro-Life activist believes that abortion is toxic to the cognitive well being of the mother. Especially because many young teenagers have abortions to reverse an unforeseen pregnancy. Like Pro-Choice organizations, Pro-Life organizations like the Nation Right to Life believes that educating the public is a key component to having a favorable result within the public. The mission statement is protect and defend the most fundamental humankind, the right to life of every innocent human being from the beginning of life to natural The NRLC also uses political action as a tool to end abortion.

In addition, religion is a major aspect for both sides. The Pro-Life movement believes that is a sin to abort a child as it is murder, and the Pro-Choice the viewpoint of not having children young or out of wedlock. Perhaps it would be of similar interest to teach women about absonence. safety and sexual consent is also a major issue as it relates to abortion.
