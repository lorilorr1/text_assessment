Rieder 1 Ty Rieder Kristian Rouisse ENC 1102.035 16 April 2017 Why GMOs Should Matter to You In any situation involving peddling a product or idea, there tends to be two or multiple stakeholders with varying perspectives on the case, typical for or against it. While active stakeholders are an important aspect of marketing, non-engaged stakeholders are what companies and organizations need to influence because they are the true deciders of whether something will prevail. An issue that correlates perfectly with the relationship between a product and a nonengaged stakeholder would be the topic of GMOs. One of the major problems that genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, have is that just saying an item is genetically modified tends to automatically insight a negative reaction in people not completely informed on the subject. Although the science behind GMOs is well understood by members of the scientific community, that information might not always resonate with the public, and since the market and the public are one in the same, the truth can get muddled when marketing GMOs. Whether people like it or not, GMOs play an important role in the agriculture industry and are essentially fueling the future generations of the occupational world. Because of this, a prime example of a non-engaged stakeholder would be people in the age range of 18 to 24, or college students to be more specific. Since students of universities will eventually become the new members of the workforce and even the parents of the new age of consumers, able to decide what food is the safest and healthiest to consume for themselves and their children. Rieder 2 To first set the stage the non-engaged stakeholders should know in more detail about what GMOs are. According to Aarts, writer of the peer reviewed Traceability of Genetically Modified Organisms, a GMO is defined as a organism that has had its genetic content altered in a non-natural way. The genetic modification is usually carried out by the insertion of genetic elements carrying the desired trait into the genome of the organism to be  (Aarts p.2). By using this method, scientists are able to genetically alter the DNA of organisms (primarily plant seeds) so that way they hold more favorable genetic straits, such as being more resilient to pests, droughts, and harsh weather. This is exactly what companies, such as Monsanto, are doing for a living; altering plant species by genetically modifying the seeds of these plants. While their is a good amount of negative stigma that come with GMOs, it is essential to look at the numerous benefits that they offer. Farmers in harsh areas can show how genetically modified seeds have improved their crop yield and are able to provide for food to more people. How well farmers do affects how much food a population has. Not only do vegetables and fruits that are genetically modified benefit the ones who grow the Genetically engineered seeds and plants make food healthier, more aesthetic looking, and prevents it from being sprayed with pesticides by making them completely obsolete. Avoiding the consumption of potentially harmful chemicals such as pesticides are not only the best interest of college students, but of everyone. With all of the dissension surrounding the use of genetically modified organisms it can be easy for college students, or anybody, to haphazardly denounce them as harmless and effective way of improving farming. If GMOs are completely eliminated from the agricultural industry, seeds that are completely void of genetic altercation could not survive harsh climates, pests, and draughts. This would directly and negatively affect farmers who are trying to produce a large Rieder 3 enough bounty for a major, thriving country. Not only would American farmers be effected by this, but agriculturist from harsher climates would not have access to genetically engineered seeds and they would have to watch their crops parish without any hope of reviving them. The problem with GMOs is the lack of interest that college students might have about genetically modified organisms. Stakeholders on both sides can utilize the ignorance of GMOs to warp the truth or refrain from dispersing it. For example, a news article on the World News Daily Report outlined the death of a 31 year old man named Juan Pedro Ramos after he ingested a tomato that was infused with fish DNA, which he was allergic to. Although the story gained traction it turned out to be completely fabricated (Papple). The tomato the article referred to was  which only contained a gene that prevented the tomato from softening too quickly and the World News Daily Report cite is notorious for reporting false information (Papple). While it is a relief that GMOs are not as dangerous as some dissenters would imply, it is fair to mention that there have been some questionable practices from Monsanto and the Food and Drug Administration. Since the 1990s, Monsanto has had ties with FDA and is scrutinized for not disclosing data that some experts were reluctant to expose the public to GMOs (Aubert). This does not mean that the government is allowing GMO corporations to negatively affect the health of citizens for a sum of money, but its still beneficial people to know the affairs of companies with departments of the government. The importance of GMOs should not be diminished by college students and the general public as a whole. Genetically modified seeds play an important role in the agricultural business Rieder 4 by producing a higher crop yield, remove the need for pesticides, and even improve the nutrients received by fruits and vegetables. If college students are actually seriously interested in the future of GMO research and use, luckily participating in the pro-GMO campaign is fairly simple. The best way to take action is just spread information about GMOs and help defend against sophistry that surrounds the genetic field of science. Although this may seem like a generic and inept way of combating ignorance, the more students that are educated about GMOs and are willing to correct contrived jargon against them is the best solution for the issue.
