Student 1 Student Dr. Jamie Thornton ENC 1102 29 January 2017 With Pain Comes Perseverance From the moment one is born, to the time one passes away, the human life cycle endures possibly the best of times and tragically the worst of times. In the case of the adverse times, people can reach substantially low points if the proper justifications are not made in a timely manner. This case can be made from an issue such as depression. The treatment of depression can be found on http://www.nps.org.au, and displays through a series of images, there is sufficient and positive path while on the route to recovery, and making quick actions to recovery is the best way to avoid falling into deep depression. To begin, the goal of NPS is to eventually find treatment for those with depression, and this can happen through the road of recovery, as indicated from the image. The primary message of this image is to create awareness about the effective treatments while on the path to recovery. The road to recovery may be long, but eventually the person with depression will reach their goals of recovery just like reaching a destination as depicted in the image. Within the image, the sun is beaming on the sign, illustrating that not only are the depressed going in the right direction, but the road to recovery will not be as bad as one may think. As portrayed in the image, the light colors may give the viewer of the picture a calming feeling because they know that everything will turn out fine. Per Jenna Sheffield of Writing Commons, can have different meanings that implicitly portray a (Sheffield). Student 2 Similarly, people may feel that the only logical way to rid the feeling of depression is to take the road of recovery. There are plenty of different paths, but the patient must choose the right path. According to NPS Medicinewise, are effective treatments for depression, but there is no single treatment that is right for everybody. Talking to a supportive family member, friend, or another health professional can also (NPS). As long as one makes the right choices, their life will return back to normal. The recovery sign portrayed may give its viewers a positive attitude. With this, the light colors in the image may give the viewer a favorable representation of what it will be like to finally undergo treatment. In a like manner, the sunlight in the image could give the onlooker a sense of warmth and hope. The viewer may feel like he or she will overcome their state of depression. Moreover, using a recovery sign with an arrow on it may let the viewer of the picture know that they will be heading down the right path if they do make the decision to opt for treatment. The sun shining on the sing may convey a feeling of happiness as well as hope for a brighter future. With this in mind, most people have the feeling of depression in their teens, around the time when they begin to drive. Having an image of a sign pointing in a direction as if leading one on as they are driving in that direction is good timing because the one with depression will feel this is relatable at the time. A progressive image may ultimately be the key to motivation in recovering. In addition, someone can easily fall into depression if they let their mind take over their gut feelings, giving off a gloomy impression. A dark theme is portrayed in this image. The body sort of fades into the darkness as if they are succumbing to the disease. A vast amount darkness surrounding the person stands out as well as the hands on the face. In the image, the victim holding her hands up seems to look as if she is cowering or is afraid of what just occurred. She may feel as though all hope is fading away, similarly to her fading away into Student 3 the darkness of the picture. Likewise, people with depression are known to feel more helpless as if the world is against them. The darkness in the image implies this. Sometimes depression can come due to a tragedy and it feels as if it is bad timing because there are so many obstacles to overcome. The image conveys a hard time that the person has fallen on, but the only way to find a way out of the issue is to keep moving forward. When people with depression look at the image, they may feel even more of a need to find treatment because they do not want the same demise as the woman in the picture. The blackness taking over the image may strike the person as an urgent need to fix their issues. As elaborated by NPS Medicinewise, experiences of depression can be quite different from one person to the next, but feeling low or sad, feeling a loss of interest and enjoyment in life, as well as feelings of guilt and worthlessness, are the usual (NPS). Although those who have depression may express themselves in different ways, the image conveyed is the overall attitude when stricken with depression. Furthermore, there seems to be a bit of a frown in the expression, giving off the notion of depression affecting the human body. If someone is looking at this picture, they may feel sad looking at the image so they might act to fix their own issue before they look like the image displayed. The only logical way out of depression is to start treatment. The image depicted may give viewers the extra motivation, or an extra knock in the head that they should treat their issue as soon as possible before it is too late. Although one may be going through depression, they should not let it take over their life. Overall, depression is a common problem, and the road to recovery can be either smooth sailing, or one will fall deeper into what can be an extremely difficult disease to overcome. There are plenty of effective treatments, but it all comes down to the person themselves. They must make the right choices and be willing to take the proper steps to help themselves.
