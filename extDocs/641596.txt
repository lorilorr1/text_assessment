Student 1 Student Professor Thornton ENC 1102 12 February 2017 The Truth About Our Food Genetically modified organisms, better known by the acronym GMOs, are organisms used for consumption that have been genetically changed in a lab. When the DNA in these organisms are altered, they become potentially harmful. Because of the dangers, GMOs are banned in countries all over the world. In North America, however, they are regulated in everyday products and sometimes do not include labels. The negligence and casual treatment of such a powerful process has raised the concern of the public. This has spurred social action like the creation of reform groups all over the country. One of the more popular groups is GMOfreeUSA.org. Organizations like GMO Free USA have been formed in order to rid North America of GMOs to prevent destructing the natural food chains of ecosystems, causing health problems to humans, and the endangerment of our animals. This group works by persuading large GMO food distributors to include labels on their products to inform the consumers of the possible dangers. With much success, they plan to eliminate the use of GMOs all together. On their website, GMOfreeUSA.org, there are vibrant pictures that stretch across the screen. These images are strategically placed to grab the attention and send a very specific message to them. One of the first images a viewer sees depicts a girl holding a sign with big letters reading that GMO To the left of the girl are two piles of buttons that can be attached to something that read with a big red circle and a line though the middle. The message of this image is clear stating that the Student 2 audience should refuse to support the breakfast company because they use GMOs to create their foods. The website creators use an array of rhetorical appeals, or strategies used mainly to persuade an audience to take their stance. One of these strategies is called ethos, which is way of establishing trust with his or her (Lane 20) In the image, ethos is used with the buttons that look very official and almost political. This lets the audience see a sense of authority on the topic and thus more trust in the cause to boycott. Another popular rhetorical appeal is called which pertains to the experience of or sensitivity toward (Lane 22) The young girl holding the sign creates a feeling of empathy in the audience and draws their compassion for what she is standing up for. The third rhetorical device, named logos to logic and (Lane 22) Since many people know the negative side effects to consuming products containing GMOs, they will feel the logical thing to do is stop buying products when they gain the knowledge about the containment of these ingredients. The final rhetorical device used on this website is known as Kairos, which is the type of persuasion that pertains to the right place and the right (Lane 25) Kairos often references current and the image shows a perfect example of one. This stakeholder takes the GMO topic very seriously and thinks that the allowance of GMOs will bring bad things to consumers. This is shown with the big letters on the sign indicating to the audience that the time is now to make a change. The first image that is being analyzed has several other features that help get their message across. The obvious feature is the bright colors used to draw in the attention and make them take the time to see what they must say. A clever phrase that rhymes like the one on the poster also has a better chance of staying in the head for a longer period. Overall the image does an excellent job of portraying the direction. Student 3 Rhetorical appeals are portrayed all through the second image being analyzed in the website. This image shows a yellow background with two identical pieces of corn labeled as organic and GMO with a large yellow safety sign in the middle. The cob of corn labeled organic has no text over it while the cob labeled GMO has white text reading various negative features across. The message of this picture is to watch out for crops that contain GMOs because they can look identical to organic crops, but have horrible things hidden inside. The attention of the audience is grabbed with the bright sign in the middle and text over the corn that requires reading to figure out what they are talking about. Ethos is shown with the big safety sign indicating authority of the subject and drawing the attention to believe it. Pathos has a presence in this image with the array of bright yellow in the middle. This creates a sense of caution in the viewer and makes their emotions feel more alert. The white text across the GMO cob of corn gives solid reason organic corn is much more advantageous. Logos appears there from the evidence drawing the attention to side with their own. Kairos is the last device and is present with the presented health issues. These serious issues make the audience feel like they need to act right away for the cause to make it stop as soon as possible. All of these combine to form a very informative and eye-opening message about the risk of GMOs. GMO Free USA has some very effective images placed on their website to provide visual representations of what they stand for. The visual cues present snatch the attention of anyone who might visit their website and give a solid summary of the message. GMOs are a very controversial topic to make a stand for, and this website is a perfect example of how to persuade someone to join what they believe in. With the hope of a GMO-free nation, the movement has gained much public support and attention. Consumers are beginning to learn the harmful effects of the organisms causing a shift in the consumer-producer relationship. With this Student 4 relationship shift, environmental protection groups are able to take advantage. At this rate, we can expect a GMO-free future. Student 5 Works Cited GMO Free USA.
