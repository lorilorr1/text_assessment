Lopez 1 Manami Lopez Lorie Jewell ENC 1101.021 5 March 2017 Different sides of the Death Penalty the arguments may be against capital punishment. . . the death penalty has been employed throughout our history, and, in a day when it is still widely accepted, it cannot be said to violate the constitutional concept of (Feldman 1317). As the overall crime rate increases in the United States, fewer states are using the death penalty to inflict punishment on the worst of those crimes. Often times, criminals get little to no punishment because they are proven as being in court. Even so, does it excuse their crime? Does being excuse a criminal of getting no punishment if they are deserving of the death penalty? These questions have become increasingly asked as the complexity of the issue has increased over the past few decades. While methods to put criminals to death (i.e. electric chair, waterboarding, lethal injection) have been refined over the years, some do not believe those methods are humane. Other communities do not believe that inflicting death upon criminals is morally right. In the past few years, the views on death penalty have changed, the methods have changed, different communities have their own opinions, and it violates human rights. To begin with, the methods of the death penalty have improved throughout, the years. As Vittorio Bufacchi, teaches philosophy at University College, Cork, Irelandand and Laura Fairrie, a current-affairs documentary producer and director living and working in London states on their article, lethal injection became more popular than hanging or electroshocking the criminals since it was perceived as a medical procedure (515). James C. Feldman is an attorney with a solo Lopez 2 practice in Washington, D.C., specializing in Supreme Court litigation. Feldman agrees that lethal injection is the predominant method of executing death row inmates in America; however, European export began to ban pharmaceutical manufacturers, refusing to supply execution drugs (1313). a drug shortages, several death penalties began considering to reinstate the use of electric chairs, firing squads, and gas raising questions and concerns about whether these methods obey the Eighth prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment (Feldman 1313). In addition, different communities have different opinions about the death penalty. Kundai Sithole was a research associate in the Department of Politics and International Studies at the University of Cambridge, discusses the Amnesty (AI) contribution to the abolition of the death penalty. They were considering the need for regional intervention to prevent European states from exposing individuals to the death penalty, this shows how much they are against the death penalty and want to abolish the death penalty (Sithole 79). Sithole also mentions, how AI led other actors in efforts to prohibit the member states from exposing individuals to the death penalty, the author believes that they can develop some mutual ideal goals towards the death penalty making an agreement on what would happen with the punishments rather than going for a death sentence (Kundai 80). Douglas L. Simon states, bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishment was created due to act amongst those who were accused and guilty of committing crimes (66). Furthermore, death penalties may be violating human rights. Feldman mentions, suggesting traditional methods of exception now violate the Eighth prohibition on cruel and unusual showing that the author may agree on death penalty as the right Lopez 3 punishment for criminals who have committed heinous crimes; however, he does not agree on going back to the methods from the past, because that violates the human rights (1314). Under the court case Gregg V Georgia reaffirming the United States the right to perform death penalty in the states a death sentence is not cruel and unusual punishment if administered in a manner that was not arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory, saying that it does not violate the constitution or human rights (Feldman 1319). Whereas, Simon mentions that the death penalty is debatable under the Eighth Amendment, Amendment law is an extension of the death penalty debate and the death proper role in a civilized (67), meaning that the death penalty should be debated again and think about how it is affecting the society. To conclude, the arguments as to the views of the death penalty has been changing constantly throughout the years. Some may agree with the actions of the death penalty and some may not. The factors that affect these arguments are the methods of practicing death penalty changes, different communities have different opinions, and some may think that it is violating human rights.
