Student 1 Student Dr. Thornton ENC 1102 26 March 2017 Tackling Mental Illness: What Should be Done? The first stakeholder in this project is the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (AADA), they are an organization that seek to educate the world about the depth of mental illness and the ways it can be treated and helped Home Anxiety and Depression Association of America, They talk about how serious mental illness can be and the affects it has. Their website offers information about treatments like medications, support groups, or even just the love and support from your community. Home Anxiety and Depression Association of America, 2017.) The second stakeholder is a website titled believe in mental illness, do this man seeks to disclaim the mental illness category (Cornwall, 2017.) He believes that mental illness is a title that society puts on suffering to somehow normalize it. What he does believe in though is natural human suffering, he believes suffering is one category. That is normal to experience the full depth of suffering and the madness and pain that it brings (Cornwall, 2017.) The ADAA seeks to educate on mental illness and the treatments to help fix these problems, the believe in mental illness, do website seeks to tell people that mental illness is a hoax, it is natural human suffering. (Cornwall, 2017.) Because mental illness is contentious, the compromise between these two organizations can be implemented through the agreement that suffering and pain do exist, whether a label is put on it or not and the ways that you can come about treating this suffering is through the love and support of your community and those around you. Student 2 The mission of the ADAA is over Anxiety and They have many advertisements on this website as well as many links that support this mission Home Anxiety and Depression Association of America, 2017.) In this way, they are attempting to fully capture the attention of those who are struggling. In the journal of Social Science and Medicine, it speaks about how mental illness is one of the most prominent forms of suffering. It explains how there are many tools and options to help those who are suffering, which this website offers links and numbers to the many resources they offer (Yang, Lui, Sullivan, & Shengdong,2016.). In the book, Mental illness: a homecare guide, a brief part of this book, where articles of the book contain first hand experiences on the topic, explains home remedies for helping and guiding those who experience mental illness. Things like home health care and programs for the family of those who are experience this difficult time of suffering. As well as tending to the one that is suffering, the family who is helping is also important (Lacy, 1989.) The main goal is to educate as many people as possible on the realness of mental illness and how much it can affect you and the people around you. They seek to understand mental illness and the workings and causes as well as show other their findings. In the journal, International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction, it speaks about how the medical community actively seeks to understand the mind as well as mindfulness. Your mind is molded by biology as well as the environment you live in. Different factors affect mind differently but yet we are all suffering in a semi same way. This looks to explain and explore that as well as the AADA seeks to explain the same. (Shonin & Gordon, 2016) Student 3 The mission of the website titled believe in mental illness, do seeks to demote mental illness as a whole (Cornwall, 2017.) The author of the article, Michael Cornwall, claims mental illness is just a title and in reality, it is natural for us all to suffer in our individual ways. He speaks about letting suffering run its course and experiencing the emotional roller coaster that comes along with it. In the article, Capture: Unraveling the Mystery of Mental Suffering, it backs up the claims of this stakeholder. It states that feeling low is a concept of nature and it should be able to run its course because something positive just might come out of it, even if it an expected way to feel and something to endure. (Lieberman, 2016) He talks about his own experiences about the suffering and brief madness he experienced during this time. He speaks about how it was natural and the only that should be administered during times of suffering is the love and support from his family, friends, and community. In the book, Mental illness: opposing viewpoints, his beliefs of mental illness not being a reality are expressed here as well. This book talks about how mental illness is too broadly defined to be a real thing. Also, with mental illness being such a broad topic people confuse the real-life suffering of some with just unusual behavior. In society, both fall under the category of mental illness (Barbour, 1995). He also believes that your physicality has a play in your mental suffering, you can give yourself treatment for suffering if you keep up with your physical health. An Article in the Kirkus Reviews adds to this claim as well. In this article, it states how attached your physical and mental beings are and that if you take care of one, you take care of the other. It talks about how people seek natural remedies for their mental sufferings and a big part of that is your physical upkeeping and healthy rejuvenation of your mind. Health, Naturally: The Family Guide to Holistic Care for a Healthy Mind and 2010.) articles opposing as well as agreeing with him, he also opens his website up to Student 4 comments from the public and has acquired quite the following. As well as creating this website discussing his beliefs, one of his main goals is to go out to the public and try to educate as many people as he can about his cause/belief. The compromise that could come between these two stakeholders is the agreement that suffering and pain effects people worldwide and something needs to be done about it. Whether there is a label on the suffering or not, there and there are ways that you can come up and out of this suffering. Both stakeholders agree that a way to get out of suffering and depression is with the undivided attention from your community. With the love and support from those around you, you can start to see that brighter days ahead. Both stakeholders wish to educate on treatments and this is one treatment they can educate the public on together. That you alone, always going to be someone around to love you and talk you out of your bad day. The reason these two stakeholders come to a compromise in the past is because it has always been a hard subject in society as well as among scholars. always been either or, never the fact that they can agree that maybe they both have valid points and that both underlying reasons are the same. People are blinded with the label of mental illness and whether real, never really just the fact that a person is suffering and there are little things you and other can do to help that person in any way that they need. The ADAA is an organization that seeks to educate the world on the seriousness of mental illness and what treatments and programs are out there that can help with this. The website believe in mental illness, do seeks to take down the title of mental illness and spread the word that there is only natural human suffering and no need for labels like mental illness. Though these two are so different, there is a compromise that can come between them. They can agree that one of the biggest stress factors in society is that people are Student 5 suffering. Whether we give it a label or not, the bottom line is people are suffering in ways that we know and one way to help those in need is through the love and support that friends, family, and the community can bring to those people. And with enough of that, those who are suffering may be able to come out of what experiencing.
