Andre Boothe English I Ms. Elizabeth Ricketts April 9 2017 Intermediate Draft for project 3 Stop and frisk is a major police policy with history tracing back to original case in the This method allows police to stop and search any person they have reasonable  of carrying a weapon or dangerous items. Due to the fact this policy is based on mostly suspicion and not evidence, it has lead to multiple arguments over constitutionality. These arguments escalated to the Terry V Ohio case in 1968 to determine if the policy was constitutional. The result deemed the original use unconstitutional and instead set a guideline on how it would be constitutional when a officer conduct a brief, investigatory stop when the officer has a reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal activity is (Belin 1502).Thanks to these results the stop and frisk method the would be a heavily used practice by the NYPD from the to today. However this policy is not foolproof and issues with the method has caused new arguments to rise over this topic. Although stop and frisk did lower the crime rate in the use of the method has lead to diminishing returns, legal issues, and conflicts between citizens and police. As a result this policy needs to be revised to create a more optimal crime prevention method. A common argument supporter of the policy will make is that it lowers the crime rate. This is true since in the the record high New York crime and homicide rates before stop and frisked was implemented more frequently. Once the policy was used more along with broken windows policing(stricter and harsher policing on minor and major crimes),law researcher Jeffery Belin statistics showed that New crime rates dropped to record lows. However this was a different story once we got to post 2000 New York. This is since during this period in studies only six percent of citizens subjected to stop and frisk were found with weapons or dangerous items. This was made worse by the fact from 2000-2011 the rate how often stop and frisk was used went up each year, despite the rate of successful stop and frisk not increasing. Overall the method was perfect for the but needs changes to be effective in a post New York City. Furthermore on the topic of stop and success other issues arose with the effectiveness. For instance the stagnant success rate being ignored as the rate of stop and frisk increased from 2000-2011 and until 2013 when they were momentarily forced to stop due to the supreme court ruling in the Floyd vs New York case. This case was a result of multiple lawsuits by citizens unhappy with how the method has been handled. After the case researcher Jeffrey Fagan came out and Anyone who says we know this is bringing the crime rate down is really making it (Matthews 4) when asked about the effectiveness of stop and frisk. Two other researchers Dennis Smith and Robert Purtell input on stop and frisk this post case was that the method  statistically significant and negative effects of the lagged stop rates on rates of robbery, burglary, motor vehicle theft, and homicide and no significant effects on rates of assault, rape, or grand (Matthews 4).To put simply stop and frisk is really effective at stop minor crime but not major crime which is a issue that needs to be look at if the policy ever gets revised. Another problem with stop and frisk is the history of legal issues that arose with using the policy. Even though Terry V Ohio made the practice legal possible signs of abusing the policy has lead to problems. For example in studies by researcher David Harris showed that many New York citizens were subjected to stop and frisk multiple times despite having no criminal record or reason for probable .Furthermore the studies showed that among all stop and frisked citizens fifty one percent of them were African American and thirty three percent of them were Latino American rising complaints over racial profiling. Those complaints escalated to the Floyd V New York case in 2013 to decide if the policy was being abused by the police. The court deemed the current use of stop and frisk unconstitutional due to violating the 4 th amendment which is against unlawful searches and seizures. It was also deemed unconstitutional due to the heavy patterns of potential racial profiling done with the method. As a result the NYDP were forced to reduce the frequency of the use and retrain their members on the method. All in all the policy needs more revision since a police policy should be used to protect citizens, not harass and discriminate against them. The other vital issue with stop and frisk is that causing more conflict between the citizens and the police. Because of the overuse of the policy combined with the possible racial profiling involved with the policy and citizens felt alienated and did not trust the police. Because of this many protests violent and non-violent occurred over the policy ironically leading to more violence when stop and frisk was meant to reduce violence. Furthermore the protests of abuse and racial profiling even have their branch of history after the Amadou Diallo incident in 1999. Here Amadou Diallo a West African immigrant was gunned down forty one times during a stop and frisk, despite having no weapons and complying with the search by emptying his pockets showing only his wallet was on him the police mistaken for a weapon. As a result a layer of distrust and hate began between New York Citizens and the police. Overall this policy is too easy to abuse and needs to be fixed so no more unarmed citizens die due to a flawed method. Overall Stop and frisk on paper is great for preventing crime but too easy to abuse. It leads to conflicts, low returns and legal incidents frequently over history and comes off as outdated instead of effective in modern New York. Personally I would revise it by giving one fixed and clear guidelines on what reasonable  since that varies way too much from officer to officer and by making it easy to abuse and cause issues while still being on paper but not constitutional in reality.
