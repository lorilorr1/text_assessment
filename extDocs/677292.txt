Student 1 Student Professor Lewis ENC 1102 5 March 2017 Options For Treating Depression It is typical for a person to believe that the life changing events cannot happen to them. Although this may be true for some, others suffer from things that make their life a bit harder to live. Depression is a low state that can affect a thoughts, behavior, feelings, and overall well-being. It has been reported that about 14.8 million American adults are affected with major depressive disorder in any given year (Depression Statistics). Of these people, many go untreated because they completely understand or they choose not to get proper help. Studies have shown that, up to 80% of those who are treated show improvement within four to six weeks (Depression Statistics). Founded in 1979, The Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) dedicates its self to educating all people on the matters of depression and other anxiety disorders. To this day, this stakeholder continues to support public health, link people who need treatment with professionals, and work to reduce the stigma surrounding depression. On the opposite side of the fence is the Association for Youth, Children, and Natural Psychology(AYCNP) where the focus is on positive non-pharmaceutical solutions for depression. Much like the first stakeholder, the AYCNP provides information for consumers and professionals for educational means. Even though these two stakeholders back a different method of treatment, they both want those affected by depression to be educated and seek help. The ADAA provides information for all who want to know it; their goal is to provide help to those who need it. This stakeholder will provide a list of local therapist and their specialties based on where one lives. In addition to connecting the affected party with local Student 2 therapist, the ADAA provides education on the different options one has as far as medication. They believe that medication treatment is generally safe and effective, which is proven time and time again in studies performed to test the effectiveness of antidepressants. Thomas Baghai states that effectiveness studies have reported a higher overall response rate of 79.6% and a remission rate of 48.8% or a response rate of 68.9% and a remission rate of 51.9% after 53.6 47.5 days of treatment in large naturalistically treated patient (215). By providing information about the different types of antidepressants, the ADAA is making sure that the patient is educated about their options upon seeking out a therapist. Although medication has been proven to treat those affected with depression, it takes time to find the right drug. With proper knowledge and background patients can mentally prepare themselves for the road to their medical journey. Alternatively, the Association for Youth, Children, and Natural Psychology seeks to educate those affected with depression and other anxiety disorders in the matters of natural treatments. These natural treatments include art therapy, music therapy, exercise, gardening, and many more. Founded in 2006 by a number of psychologist and educators, this stakeholder fills the gap in the mental health field (Association for Natural Psychology). The idea is that by making health and positive changes in life, their mood will improve as well. A study performed in 1993 by W.K. Koehler reported a improvement of mood . . . following 2 weeks of training on a stationary bicycle between 6:00 and A later study found that a 50% improvement in depressed individuals following 12-day aerobic treatment from 07:00 to 8:00 (Putilov). In addition, the AYCNP favor natural treatment because of the substantial evidence that suggest patients being over-diagnosed and over-prescribed for the mental illnesses. Brad Partirdge reports that in the last decade use of psychotropic medications to treat Student 3 common mental health problems has In a study of 1293 participants, 57.7 percent of them agreed that too many people are diagnosed with depression when they actually have it (1,4). In 2014, Time Magazine published a list of natural remedies that effectively treat those with depression. This list includes transcranial magnetic stimulation, acupuncture, exercise, meditation, and interpersonal therapy and interpersonal therapy (Sifferlin). In the case of a person who chooses to get treated without antidepressants, just a matter of finding what works best. Both the ADAA and the AYCNP are interested in educating all parties involved on the affairs of depression. These stakeholders have dedicated their time and effort into providing information, treatment, and resources to break down the stigma society has about this mental illness. As far as treatments, the ADAA strongly suggest gaining the help of a licensed professional, while the AYCNP offers an alternative route that forego prescription drugs all together. In an effort to show solidarity to all who suffer from depression, these two stakeholders may want to work together to support all spectrums of the issue. It important that those who do not want to take the everyday route to treatment have the resources to provide them with alternate solutions. If the goal is to provide help for those in need then why do stakeholders only provide one method of relief for those who need it. Studies have shown that patients have found that combining psychotherapy with medication offers the most complete relief (Pain, Anxiety, And Depression). To start the process of creating a solid foundation, both organizations need to recognize the methods offered by the other. This was upon visiting either stakeholder, those affected with depression will feel that they have options instead of being back into a corner. Next, both stakeholders should encourage the affected visit a professional with the information they have learned about depression. In order to Student 4 get the best results a professional should be involved in the road to recovery. This way patients can properly attain a treatment that contains natural methods and antidepressants if needed. Thus, creating an environment where the user feel safe and knowledgeable. Although the ADAA and the AYCNP have different views on how to treat depression, both views can be combined to create a power house. This new-found support system can help people of all ages properly asses their depression and chose the best method of treatment for them. The great thing about using natural therapy to treat depression is that it targets the interests. No matter what the case people want options; they want to feel like they have a say in going on in their life. In the end, both of these stakeholders want to educate people about the matters of depression. There is no better way to do this than to show all sides of the matter at hand.
