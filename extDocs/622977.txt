Chase Fisher Hanson ENC 1102 January 29, 2017 Self-Driving Cars Hitting the Road Self-driving cars are coming into the world. These vehicles have been met with criticism and praise. The rapid development these vehicles have seen in the past decade has allowed them to hit public roads, but this brings concern to some groups. The Center for Auto Safety (CAS) believes that these vehicles are not ready for the road. The lack of National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regulation is a major concern. Ethical and safety issues are a concern; they believe more regulation needs to be in place before these vehicles are on public roads. On the other side, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) supports these vehicles, looking at the safety that the vehicles bring. Such as lowering the 94% of accidents that caused by human error (Automated Vehicles). Their current policy for these vehicles puts in place safety tests and regulatory tools that has a relaxed NHTSA oversight. These groups cannot deny that these vehicles will replace the current driver-dependent, they both want the vehicles implemented but disagree on the amount of regulation required. To please both organizations the self-driving vehicle needs to have proper regulation and get on the road to prove its value. The Center for Auto Safety was founded in 1970 with the goal to provide consumers a voice for auto safety and quality. The group has many accomplishments, among which are implementing lemon laws in every state and safety and highway standards that have dropped the death rate on road. This group primarily takes on the auto giants and fights for the consumer. In regards to self-driving cars, the Center for Auto Safety says can and should have both ethical automobile technology and lifesaving mandated safety (Lemov). They believe that more regulation should be in place to ensure that these vehicles are safe and can make ethical decisions. The CAS disagrees with the regulatory abstinence and believes they should use their regulatory powers to ensure that these vehicles are safe for public roads. Currently the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy says that manufactures have self-certify that their vehicles meet the Federal Vehicle Safety Standards. The CAS claims that this supports their argument that there is a lack of regulation. More safety issues arise when looking at how long it takes a driver to respond to a situation in a self-driving vehicle. The issue of response time was researched by Virginia Tech, they that it took drivers of Level 3 cars [in which the driver can fully cede control of all safety-critical functions in certain an average of 17 seconds to respond to takeover (Neumann). This is a concern because it shows that drivers do not think that these vehicles could need their assistance at any time. This lack of education and lack of regulation is what the CAS fears. The Center for Auto Safety has been fighting for safety which the public realized was required when the first self-driving fatality occurred. Safety of self-driving cars is now a more public issue and requires discussion and regulation. The National Highway Transportation Safety core values are the highest standards of excellence in motor vehicle and highway (Automated Vehicles). The organization believes that the development of self-driving cars is important to the safety of the road. The NHTSA says that this technology can help the reduce the 94% of crashes which are caused by human error (Automated Vehicles). Currently this organization regulates self-driving cars and has multiple regulatory tools in their policy. A critical point of this policy is the 15 point which outlines safe design, development, testing, and deployment of automated vehicles (Automated Vehicles). Accelerated development of these vehicles is a goal of this group to reach their goal of lowering the amount of crashes caused by human error. These vehicles do not get drunk, distracted, or tired; which are involved in 41 percent, 10 percent, and 2.5 percent of all fatal crashes, respectively (Paddock, Kalra). These vehicles also can react faster than any person ever could to a situation. These perks of a self-driving car show that is should already be safer than human drivers, but more tests are needed to prove their worth. To show that the vehicles are safe they need data from real world road driven autonomous cars. google has been developing a self-driving car for years, their car has traveled 1.3 million miles on public roads and has had 11 crashes from 2009 to 2015 (Paddock, Kalra). This data helps the NHTSA show that self-driving cars are safe and do not get into as many accidents as the normal human driver. This data helps the NHTSA to encourage companies to develop the self-driving cars which will provide great safety improvements. While self-driving cars currently do not seem as safe as the human driver, they will eventually be much safer than the human ever could be. To get to this level of safety the Center for Auto Safety thinks slow, impactful testing needs to take place. They believe that the vehicle cannot be put on public roads if their safety is not guaranteed. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration wants to get these vehicles on the road as soon as they are available. This desire means little regulation on the development and safety as the is self- certified by the manufacturers. Their desire for accelerated development creates a lack of safety regulations which the Center for Auto Safety disagrees with. The Center for Auto Safety says that the self-certifying assessment along with the Department of strong encouragement to to allow the DOT alone to regulate the performance of HAV [Highly Automated technology and (Brooks). The National Highway Traffic Safety desire to get these vehicles on the road fast and the Center for Auto desire to have the vehicles on the road when they are ready is conflicting. To solve this the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration needs to regulate the vehicles safety and development more and the Center for Auto Safety needs to see how these vehicles perform on the road. this compromise will give the Center for Auto Safety the confidence that that vehicles are being looked at by a regulatory agency before being put to the road. This will also please the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as the vehicles they believe will make the road a much safer place will be able to get on the road quickly and hopefully start preventing accidents.
