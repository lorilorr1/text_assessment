1 Dr. Thornton ENC 1102 16 April 2017 Penny? In this day and age, saving pennies and seems to be every favorite hobby; some even seem to be professionals. Those little pennies that they seem to grabbing at are the same things that are silently putting us in an economical foot hole (FIX THIS SENTENCE). Everyday, the US mints pennies that are worth one cent, for 1.7 cents (Ingraham). This means that the US penny is operating on a 70% deficit. Considering that The United States Reserve mints on average, according to Laura Bruce of Brankrate, 1,040 pennies a minute, which equates to 30 million pennies a day, making the penny responsible for 2/3 of all the coins produced in the United States. There have been propositions to look at the materials that go into the penny, and adjust it to fix our current economic needs (do I need a source here?), there have also been propositions to eliminate the penny entirely from circulation. The current method of penny production needs to be reviewed to ensure that we a have an economical future by either changing the materials that comprise a penny, or eliminate it from our federal circulation. The composition of the penny has been changed many times in our American history, but currently a penny produced today, according to the US Treasury Department, contains 97.6 percent zinc and only 2.4 percent copper, which is the root of our problem. Copper, the outermost layer of the coin, is not only the least represented, but also the most expensive. According to data collected by NASDAQ, the pricing trend of copper has been on 2 a steady rise in the past two years. This rise in cost of copper may be the reasoning behind the deficit in the cost of production of the coin. But there have been calls for the main component of the penny, copper, to be replaced. Robert Pike, a professor at The College of William and Mary, has proposed materials such as entirely steel or zinc coins, he has even extended to materials such as ceramics and plastics as a core to be cover by a thin metal plating (Wolchover). Switching over to a material such as steel would drastically reduce the price of production of the penny, switching to a material that can be manufactured in in large batches, such as ceramics and military grade plastics could lower the cost even further. One aspect of a system with new materials that is constantly over looked is the operation of machines that rely on the weight of coins to register their value. Machines such as soda machines, and snack vending machines that weigh the coin upon entry would have to have their hardware changed, or their systems to accept the new coin (Wolchover) It is then further proposed by Dr. Pike that pennies and nickels literally become loose  if they contain metals or ceramics with lower densities than zinc they might not register in Even though there have been calls to action by President Barrack Obama in his 2012 budget, which outlined plans to investigate new penny and nickel production methods; there have been other calls to action, by people that are willing to take more aggressive action. Citizens to Retire the U.S. Penny is an organization who want to educate Americans on the benefits of taking the penny out of circulation by presenting them with the fact of the penny. Facts like the cost deficits caused by the production of pennies is enough to help the federal budget with as much as $100 million. As well as the long list of countries that 3 have done away with their smallest denomination of currency; the closest example being our northern Canadian neighbors who have done away with their penny within the last 2 years because of the production deficit it caused their federal budget (Mint). Since their smallest denomination is now the nickel, they have adopted a rounding system for cash transaction, while leaving their credit and debit transaction unaffected. Members of Citizens to Retire the US Penny are bypassing a change in production, and looking straight to an elimination system like this. Phasing out the penny like other countries have done as easy as it sounds. Eliminating the smallest currency comes with its own ups and downs, literally. Canada had to universally adopt a rounding system put forth by its Treasury Department. The system states that firstly transaction being tendered in debit or credit cards would be unaffected by the rounding system, it next states that totals equating to $1.01 or $1.02 and $1.06 or $1.07 would be rounded down to $1.00 and $1.05 respectively; while $1.03 or $1.04 and $1.08 or $1.09 would round up respectively to $1.05 and $1.10 (Mint). Looking at the system, the rounding could affect peoples budget (Elaborate) (WC: 925) 4 Work Cited Ingraham, Christopher.
