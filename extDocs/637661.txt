Aung Khaing Harley Campbell ENC1102.089 23 January 2017 Cancer Research and approaches, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy There are many factors that ends a life, no matter who they are, what their age or sex is. However, there is a deadly disease that devour life cells, taking away thousands of life every year, cancer, can be the most stealthy and dangerous illness that human fear for centuries. This disease can happen on anyone regardless of age and gender. Scientists and researchers are working their entire life to find effective ways to cure cancer, and many stood up to form organizations they gather funds and provide resources to accelerate the research progress. Cancer Research Institute (CRI), is a non-profit organization that uses of human to fight back cancer. Similar organization, Cancer Research UK (CR UK), approach is to speed up drug development and many other multiple ways to cure cancer. Both organizations are trying to cure cancer, but they have different approaches. They want to find absolute answers to win against cancer as soon as possible, because every year there are many people suffering and dying from cancer. CR UK and CRI can enhance their research by establishing a laboratory where both sides share the benefit of research data, and the goal is always the same, to win against cancer. Khaing 2 The first stakeholder, Cancer Research Institute or CRI, is a nonprofit organization that devote in research of immune system, which they believe to be the key to conquer cancer. It was founded by Helen Coley Nauts in 1953, her father Dr. William B. Coley was a pioneer in non-surgical treatment para.1). Their main goal is to cure cancer by using immunotherapy, and finally completely remove cancer out of human bodies Tormey para.1). Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses body immune system to treat illness, which also include cancer (American Cancer Society 1). CRI has been researching immune system for many decades and working with other organizations like AACR and STAND UP TO CANCER From establishing many programs that support young scientists and students to learn more about immunology, open conferences to increase the efficiency, and collaboration with many other organizations, CRI become well known for its research focus In order to reach their goal further investment and research is essential, as immunotherapy is new among all other treatments, which might not be as efficient as chemotherapy or radiotherapy. However, it can be the safest treatment compare to the other. Therefore, if CRI can have a secondary method for cure, there can be improvement in the way of treatment, and CR UK can be a great organization that CRI can work with, despite the differences in approaches. Secondly, Cancer Research UK (CR UK) is also a non-profit organization that is aim to beat cancer. Their research field has a wide range of focus, which include surgery, radiotherapy Khaing 3 techniques and drugs (CR UK). CR UK is trying to deal with all type of cancer in any way they can, for example, precaution can be taken by not smoking and eat healthy food, and kept children away from those harms (CR UK). Their current goal is to increase the survival rate to 75 percent, and finally conquer cancer. Even though CR is an organization that focus on cancer problems that occur in the United Kingdom, they plan to work on global scale. In fact, CR UK had funded in drug research and brings organizations in the UK to collaborate to improve the research (CR UK). Thanks to their influences in the UK they could raise many charity for their research, and they are being trusted in the UK, as well as around the world. Though CR UK has been finding multiple way for cure, their focus is more on chemotherapy and biological therapies, and drug play a major role is these treatments. In fact, chemotherapy means drugs treatment. In the article Comparison Of Four Chemotherapy Regimens For Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung , Schiller explained that one third of cancer patients are suffering from lung cancer and drug treatment prove a high success rate (Schiller para.12). Both old and new methods are continuing to make a breakthrough and can be very essential, but there are also side effects that must take into consideration. Therefore, for the sake of beating cancer, more experiment and research are required, this need both organization to consider the possibilities and benefits of oversea laboratory. To begin with, CRI believe that immunotherapy can be the only and the best solution to cure cancer for the long-term and for future, which indeed, have the potential. Where on the other Khaing 4 hand CR UK is acting to solve the problem that is occurring now, planning to reduce cancer patient of the United Kingdom by various method. These methods include promoting non- smoking, educating people to stay healthy, and research of treatments with a major focus on drug development. However, both wants to find way to cure cancer so that there are less people with cancer, and more people survive from cancer. They have been working with organizations in their country, collaborating for share of research data to the public. However, to solve cancer; that had been a deadly disease for centuries, unpredictable amount of time will be taken, and more research data and tests must be carry out. By establishing a new laboratory in US and bring in scientists from the youth to help research, to boost the research. To be able to do this, a third-party organization is required for managing the laboratory, and International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) can be the one. IARC had been working to promote international collaboration for cancer research, bring organizations together and raise charity around the world (IARC). Since, CRI and CR UK is in two different continents, a third-party organization like IARC; which focus on bring organizations and research across countries around the world including countries that has middle or low income. Records and data is extremely essential in cancer research, because every illness is unique is its own way depend on the patient, so the test results can help improve the research, especially when it comes to drug tests. Things that the organizations need to give off will be funds and research data, and with IARC, research will go on a global scale, therefore they Khaing 5 will need more fund and must raise more charities. Finally, with the establishment of this new laboratory, not only CRI and CR UK will be benefit from the collaboration, IARC will have two reliable organizations to promote themselves in foreign country. There are more than 200 types of cancer and many ways to cure, where one can be more effective than another in each type of cancer. However, immunotherapy has great promise for the future, where chemotherapy is the among the most effective treatment to cancer. Scientists and doctors around the world want to find cure for this disease, and everyone wants to end the tragedy. The road is long, but there is always way to increase the speed, and for everyone around to get the same treatment as the leading country, people must act on and organizations must build bridges that connect the needs.
