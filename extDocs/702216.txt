Student 1 Student Professor Gaspar ENC 1102 26 March 2017 Natural Gas: The Solution to Energy? With the increasing concern over fossil fuels and their impact on the environment, many companies are searching for a solution that involves a less harmful renewable resource. One solution found is fracking; a drilling procedure used to extract oils and natural gases from deep underground (Lallanilla, About This procedure involves drilling a well roughly two miles vertically underground, and then two miles horizontally so that chemically treated water, and proppants sand and ceramic -can be pumped into the well and fracture the surrounding rock (Lallanilla, About Once fractured, the gas and oil in the rock are released and pumped to the surface with liquid containing numerous contaminants (Lallanilla, About This is not a solution that is all around accepted though. Advocates of fracking claim that it is a safe, and reliable source of energy; critics, however, claim that is leads to contamination of drinking water and an increase in earthquakes. One advocate for fracking is a company called Natural Gas Alliance. They promote the use of natural gas in place of fossil fuels and claim that it is the energy Natural Gas The organization, Greenpeace, on the other hand, believe that fracking is a destructive process and is no better for the environment than fossil fuels Although Greenpeace and Natural Gas Alliance have incompatible views on whether fracking should be allowed as a source of an alternative energy, a compromise can be reached that allows fracking but creates regulations and restrictions to minimize the effects on the environment. Student 2 For example, Natural Gas Solution (ANGA), is a strong advocate for the use of natural gases and fracking. Their primary goal is to change the energy equation using natural gas instead of fossil fuels Natural Gas ANGA has three principal arguments to support the use of natural gases. The first argument is that natural gas is clean Natural Gas This argument means that by using natural gas as a power source instead of coal, CO2 and other heavy metal emissions that are a main concern because of increasing concentrations in the atmosphere, will be reduced drastically. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that using natural gas has reduced the CO2 emissions by almost two-thirds since 2006 Natural Gas Use is Increasing, While Emissions are These statistics prove that using natural gas has a positive effect on the environment by reducing the amount of emissions that are released. It is further proved by a graph from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) which shows that methane emissions from natural gas systems have decreased by 0.68% while the production of natural gases have increased by 47.3% (EPA, of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and second claim is that natural gas is reliable Natural Gas ANGA states that in our country, energy is used almost constantly in our lives and that natural gas power can fluctuate with all our needs Natural Gas final argument is that gas is Natural Gas According to the most recent IHS study, trillion cubic feet of natural gas can be developed for around $3 per cubic is nearly twice as much gas recoverable for just a dollar (Marn, Resource Base Continues to Expand in Volume and Decrease in This means that natural gas is a very affordable source of energy and that there is an abundance of it for the future. Student 3 Overall, ANGA has many strong arguments in favor of using fracking to produce natural gases because it is a clean energy source, reliable, and affordable. On the other hand, Greenpeace strongly believes that fracking is damaging to the environment and is not a good source of alternate energy. The primary goal of Greenpeace is to peaceful protest and creative communication to expose global environmental problems and promote solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful This organization believes that fracking is expensive, more polluting, and more dangerous than clean, renewable They have numerous arguments against the use of fracking because of the effect that it has on the environment. Their first argument is that fracking uses too much water, and the water that it uses is contaminated Each time a well is fracked, more than 3.6 million gallons of water are used, which is a lot in states with limited supply of water In addition, the EPA conducted a study on connection to drinking water in the United States. They discovered that there were more than 150 instances of groundwater contamination due to fracking (U.S., Study of Hydraulic Fracturing for Oil and Gas and Its Potential Impact on Drinking Water This data shows that there is contamination from fracking, and that it can have negative impacts on the environment, as well as humans. The second argument Greenpeace states is that there is a connection between fracking and increased earthquakes since 1990 Scientists have completed studies showing that between 1967 and 2000, Oklahoma averaged 21 earthquakes above a 3.0 per year, but since 2010 it has averaged more than 300 above a 3.0 magnitude (Injection-Induced Earthquakes). These earthquakes are due to the wastewater disposal by injection into deep wells, but the process of fracking itself poses a low risk for inducing those stronger earthquakes (Ellsworth, The final argument of Greenpeace is that fracking Student 4 is a source of air pollution due to emissions. The study on the health implications of fracking shows that the spills from fracking, the emissions from gas-processing equipment, and the emissions from vehicles transporting machinery and gas may create harmful pollutants (Kovats, Health Implications of This is evidence that supports what Greenpeace states about the harm it causes to the environment. In all, main arguments include; fracking creates water contamination, fracking is linked to increased earthquakes, and fracking emits environmental pollutants. Greenpeace strongly believes that fracking should not be an alternate source of energy. Although both companies disagree whether fracking should be used as an alternate source of energy, they do have common interests that are shared. For example, both companies have the environment in mind. Both companies want the amount of harm done to the environment by fossil fuels to be reduced using an alternate source of energy. Despite their incompatible goals, Greenpeace and ANGA are concerned with the amount of emissions that released into the atmosphere by fossil fuels, and many other effects of using fossil fuels. In the past, the EPA enacted a Clean Power Plan for power plants Power Plan for Existing Power This plan was to reduce the carbon pollution from power plants to combat climate change Power Plan for Existing Power With this plan, environmental organizations like Greenpeace would be happy that emissions were being reduced, and companies owning power plants were still able to generate power. In the case of fracking, both stakeholders give a little to compromise and create a solution. For example, ANGA, and other companies employing the use of fracking, can agree to strict regulations on their disposal of wastewater and other regulations on their processes of the procedure. Greenpeace must then allow fracking to continue as a source of alternate energy. Greenpeace will benefit because there will be strict regulations Student 5 on the disposal of wastewater that was used in fracking. This would reduce the amount and magnitude of earthquakes caused in addition to reducing any water contamination. Greenpeace will also benefit from regulations placed on the procedures of fracking because it will reduce or eliminate environmental pollutants and contamination. ANGA, and other fracking companies, will benefit because they are still able to use fracking as a procedure to obtain natural gas. Both stakeholders benefit because the effects on the environment are reduced. This process will make the transition from fossil fuels that both companies want. To implement this compromise, certain laws must be created and approved by legislation. This compromise takes the incompatible goals of each stakeholder and creates a solution that both stakeholders benefit from. In either case, because of the concern over increasing CO2 emissions in the atmosphere, people are looking for alternate sources of energy that are less harmful to the environment. With the decline in availability of accessible oil, many companies are also looking for alternate sources of energy. Hydraulic fracking is one method of procuring natural gases from underground as a source of energy; however, there are differing views on whether this procedure should be allowed. One advocate of fracking is the stakeholder Natural Gas Alliance; who believe that the natural gases procured from fracking are a clean, reliable, and affordable solution. The second stakeholder, Greenpeace, believes the opposite; that fracking is a harmful and unsafe procedure that should not be allowed. When both stakeholders give a little, a compromise can be reached that benefits both companies. The compromise is that there will be strict regulations on the disposal of wastewater that was used in fracking to reduce the amount and magnitude of earthquakes caused, in addition to reducing any water contamination. Regulations will also be placed on the procedures of fracking because it will reduce or eliminate environmental pollutants and contamination. This compromise creates a solution to the Student 6 incompatible goals by taking their common goals and allowing both companies to benefit.
