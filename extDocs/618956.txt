Osorio 1 Nicolas Osorio Dorinda Davis Composition II 28 January 2017 Head in the Game: Should College Athletes Be Paid Like Professional Athletes? Professional student athletes? Professional athletes, by definition, are individuals paid to entertain and perform to the best of their abilities in a certain sport. Student-athletes are participants in a competitive program that is offered by an educational institution. These individuals balance the life of a full-time athlete and a full-time student. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is the athletic institution that organizes and provides the monetary resources for all the athletic collegiate tournaments. To become a one must meet certain requirements. According to the NCAA webpage one needs to earn a GPA of minimum a 2.3 in minimum 16 courses from a high school, meet the sliding scale requirement of GPA and test and to have the required physical set of skills to be part of the program. During the past decade the NCAA and the College players association (CAPA) have been debating the differences and similarities between professional and student athletes. Should student athletes receive the same benefits professional athletes receive? Do student athletes work as hard as professional athletes? Are student athletes participants or employees of an athletic program? Through the past decade athletic programs like football, basketball, baseball and soccer have become more rigorous and time consuming. Due to these circumstances many have begun to wonder if student athletes should be compensated for dedicating their daily lives to their sport. Osorio 2 Should student athletes receive an annual salary? Several lawsuits that address the issue of student-athletes earning an annual salary have demanded some certain conditions. According to the Northern District of California decision, which student-athletes from earning money from the use of their likeness in video games, were an unreasonable restraint on students cannot earn any sort of monetary resources from anyone while they are part of any athletic program. Recently, the Northern District of court decision was upheld by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals addressing them as rules that violate antitrust laws, causing confusion and scandal. One of the other lawsuits addressed the NCAA, describing how programs from different institutions were unfairly using the athletic scholarships given to student athletes, as excuses for students to practice instead of attending their classes. An example of this is the Northwestern University Football team, who asked the National Labor Relations Board to entitle their team as employees of Northwestern University since the student athletes claim that they are being treated as employees. Another example is a well-known football play Chris Burnette from the University of Georgia, who expressed his outraged through his twitter the issue the NCAA is full of crap. Being a college athlete who profit of your own name?! NCAA give him his talent or his name. Chris Burnette is just one of the student athletes that has been living an economic struggle that is in need for action. These are just some of the numerous examples that can be found about the injustice that student athletes go through in their daily lives. On the other hand, the National Collegiate Athletic Association has been going through a secret economic crisis, one that could lead to the disappearance of the athletic departments of many educational institutions around the nation. The ASHE expresses their ideals in the article NCAA Division I Athletic Funding by addressing the economic problems that the NCAA have been facing during the past decade. Certain factors like the increase on the tuition would Osorio 3 obligate the athletic programs to offer full ride scholarships to most of the athletes who cannot afford to be part of the community. Nonetheless if tuitions decreased, the amount of money given to the athletic department for scholarships and student athlete supplies would decay. Hurricane Katrina was one of the many other factors that affected universities like the University of New Orleans which led catastrophic consequences on the entire campus leading the entire department to quit the Division I program to enter the Division III program, which does not offer athletic scholarships. According to the ASHE abandoned the institution. In conclusion the athletic programs across the entire nation are suffering from an economic crisis that needs to be taken care of, perhaps, by supplying monetary aid that could subside most of the programs or some emergency aid educational institutions could supply to the athletic departments. The NCAA supplies for every athletic department around the nation with no economic equilibrium then it is highly probable that new policies like student-athletes earning an annual salary would be denied and would not be prioritized. Nonetheless the current V. NCAA decision represents the first step on the road to a compromise. According to Victoria Rossler it was decided that athletes have a right in products that exploit their image and which provides student athletes with the chance to fight for their intellectual rights. Intellectual rights that signature moves and different sorts of celebrations, like touchdown dances. It was also decided that educational institutions will receive part of this compensation from the students that are part of their athletic program and this would be evenly split between both the student and the educational institution, so that the money received could be invested on the athletic program to improve its conditions. This way both could find a compromise and found benefit from it. Osorio 4 Finally, the NCAA objective will always be to prepare the student-athletes with the best tools and set of skills to survive and live a life full of success and achievements. Student-athletes will always be provided with the aid needed. In order for them to find the full compromise there has to be another private party that fulfills what is missing, a party that provides the monetary resources that are needed for both the NCAA and the student athletes.
