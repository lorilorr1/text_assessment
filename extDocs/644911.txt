Ohnmacht 1 Tyler Ohnmacht Theodosiou ENC-1102 1/29/17 Ridesharing and Taxis, A Look at Common Ground There are over 50,000 taxi drivers in New York, and for years they were one of the main modes of transportation for the people of New York, and they have been protected by their union, the New York Taxi Workers Alliance (NYTWA). In recent years however, the once untouchable taxi industry has been fighting another transportation service; these are ridesharing companies like Uber and Lyft, and they have come out of nowhere to challenge the taxi industry for their place as one of the top ways of transportation in New York. Uber which is one of the most popular ride sharing apps currently has about 30,000 drivers working in the city (NextCity.org). Due to the way Uber operates, having their employees operate as independent contractors it allows them to often have cheaper fares and more drivers on the road than the taxi companies can compete with. As a result these two companies often but heads while competing for the business of New commuters, however with some slight changes to the local legislature, mostly to the outdated taxi regulations, these two companies could have a healthy amount of fair competition between them, which on the whole would benefit the consumer most of all. The New York Taxi Workers Alliance (NYTWA) is a union that works for the taxi drivers of the city. Their mission statement is that they for justice, rights, respect and dignity for the over 50,000 licensed men and (NYTWA.org). On their website the Ohnmacht 2 NYTWA calls the taxi industry a in an effort to show how overlooked taxi drivers can be in the grand scheme of the city (NYTWA.org). Even though there are nearly fifty-thousand taxi drivers in the city there are only roughly thirteen thousand taxis. This is because there is a limited amount of taxis allowed on the road by law. In order to be a legitimate taxi in the city of New York, one must buy a taxi medallion. David Gabel in his paper and the Persistence of Market he gives a brief explanation of how taxi medallions work saying taxi medallion authorizes a given automobile to operate as a taxi within a given area. Historically, cities have sold a limited number of medallions in order to restrict the number of (Gabel 529). This is one of many problems that the NYTWA has echoed in their protests of Uber. Another point that the NYTWA classes as unfair competition is that employees need only personal insurance, they plan to protest a bill that Uber and Lyft are lobbying for on June 1st which would allow Uber drivers to have lower insurance standards than taxis. The NYTWA stated that this is an example of Uber trying to the insurance coverage, lower the premium, the higher they can charge on the This point is also noted by Gabel when showing why Uber rates are usually lower than taxi costs saying is able to provide services at a lower price, in part, because its drivers are subject to less regulation. . .yellow cab drivers are required to carry expensive commercial, rather than personal insurance and to obtain a license. . drivers and cars, on the other hand, are exempt from these (Gabel 529). With Uber being able to provide services at a cheaper rate without the NYTWA being able to compete due to outdated regulations they feel they are not being justly represented and are pushing for deregulation of the taxi industry, or more strict regulation placed on Uber. Ohnmacht 3 Uber is a ridesharing service based out of California. It Emerged in San Francisco in 2010. On their website Uber claims it was founded when Kalanick and Garrett Camp had trouble hailing a cab. So they came up with a simple a button, get a (Uber.com). In the past seven years Uber has blossomed into much more than the original idea. On their website Uber states their original intent was to just have a few black cars in metropolitan areas, has now turned into the biggest competitor to the taxi industry. They have gone beyond just rides in some cities, like New York Uber can deliver food to customers. One ofthe challenges Uber faces in landscape is being noticed as a legitimate transportation service. Even though they are often seen as better than the traditional taxi Uber still faces some challenges in the transportation industry. In a case study done in Barcelona, showing what would happen if the government managed on demand transport like Uber or Taxis Uber was found to be more cost efficient with the report saying is the same for both taxi and car sharing services, with a supply of 53 veh/km2 , but with a three times higher unitary cost for the taxi (Cuevas, Estrada, Salanova 164). This means that if there were 53 vehicles per square kilometer it would be three times less costly to use Uber than taxi services. Studies like this one show the viability of Uber in major cities. Companies like Uber also promote competition within the industry. If ridesharing had not taken off, the taxi industry would have never tried to reform itself. Uber brings an essential part of capitalism, competition, forcing the taxi industry to better itself to stay in business, although not always great for the taxi industry it is overall better for the consumer; thus the competition Uber brings, benefits the customer. Although these two stakeholders are seemingly at odds, there is a complete possibility for them to come together to find common ground and compromise. They both focus on transporting Ohnmacht 4 people, in this case around the city of New York. The NYTWA wants to keep taxi workers employed, and make sure they are paid and treated fairly. Uber is entirely focused on maximal ease of use and convenience for the customer. Overall both stakeholders have to focus on efficiency, convenience, and fair treatment of their workers. If both stakeholders worked together they could get the proper changed enacted to ensure the best future for both of these groups. The solution needed is a change of the local legislature. An article written by Katie Barglind in the Wisconsin Law Journal, she points out that the state of Victoria, Australia has a compromise between the local taxis and Uber. She points out the two major aspects of the Victoria reform being reduce or eliminate restrictions on the supply of taxis that limit choice and increase prices for consumers; (2) while ensuring that technological change that can benefit consumers is not (Barglind 725). This is a similar idea for a compromise here, if Uber and the NYTWA protested certain regulations they could achieve reform that would allow progress, but still allow competition. This would require reform of section 59 of the New York City legislature, this section contains the legislature limiting the number of taxis, as well as the law requiring taxi cab drivers to have commercial insurance (NYCA). These two laws would be the ones in need of the most reform for the NYTWA. A fee could be placed on Uber trips instead and that fee would be paid by Uber but could be in part passed to the customers. A fee similar to this was implemented in Victoria at two dollars per trip, and is pointed out by Barglind in her paper (Barglind 726). If Uber were to be fined they would then be entirely legitimized by one of the most major cities in the United States, this would most likely help them settle other cases of unrest in other places around the world as well. Uber could also possibly retain an exclusive right to use autonomous cars once companies like Tesla have them road safe. Uber has already Ohnmacht 5 expressed its interest in autonomous vehicles and so if they were to have driverless cars they would benefit by generating more profit. This exclusivity would also most likely help taxis as well, as the switch to autonomous cars would surely be shocking to some and so would offer an alternative to having a robot drive New Yorkers around the city. If both groups came together to lobby New congress to reform these laws it would be entirely possible for them to convince congress to reform section 59 of New legislature. All in all both the NYTWA and Uber have the best interests at heart for their consumers, even if neither of the stakeholders are perfect. Although these groups will always be in competition with each other, that does not mean they cannot work together.With cooperation between these groups their combined influence over the transportation industry could lead to reforms that shape how we commute for the generations to come.
