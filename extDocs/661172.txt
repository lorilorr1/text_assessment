Peoples 1 Corynn Peoples Professor Theodosiou ENC1102-075 23 February 2017 The Surfrider Foundation and Plastic Waste Throughout the years, our ocean has been facing an exponential rise in marine animal deaths caused by plastic pollution. Around eight million metric tons of plastic waste enters the ocean from land, increasing the amount of debris that a marine animal encounters (Sebille). The Surfrider Foundation has been devoting their time and money to decrease the amount of plastic waste and to reuse as much of it as possible. To achieve their goal, the Surfrider Foundation has utilized advertisements to convey their message of animal suffering and environmental degradation that results from an increase in the consumption of plastic products. The two specific images that were chosen represents these negative impacts and works to bring the attention of the consumers to this ongoing issue. Peoples 2 The Surfrider Foundation is an organization that is dedicated to the protection and enjoyment of the ocean, waves, and beaches through a powerful activist network (Surfrider Foundation). This organization works to ensure that our beaches are accessible, our water is clean, our coast is preserved, and plastic is kept from polluting our waterways (Surfrider Foundation). They are also concerned with the welfare of marine animals and their ecosystems as the ocean is experiencing a dramatic rise in pollution. Plastic debris has impacted at least 267 species through ingestion, starvation, suffocation, entanglement, and infection (Clean Water Action). Plastic can also carry pollutants such as PCBs that can eventually pass up the food chain and affect human health (Center for Biological Diversity). It is the Surfrider overall goal to educate the public on the impact that the unsustainable use of resources, especially the use of disposable products, has on the environment and encourage people to participate in conservation efforts to prevent an even larger amount of debris from reaching the ocean. For both images, it is implied that the Surfrider Foundation is targeting an audience of consumers who purchase and waste plastic products such as bottles, lighters, food wrappers and plastic bags. It does not seem that it is intended for a certain gender or age group as it can apply to anyone and everyone who has purchased plastic. With this audience in mind, the Surfrider Foundation utilizes the rhetorical appeals of ethos, pathos, logos, and kairos effectively through their advertisements to spark a change in mindset in how people consume. Ethos, the appeal to credibility, is visibly present in each of the advertisements as the logo of the Surfrider Foundation is stamped in the corner. Not only that, but a link to their website for the audience to click on to obtain more information on how to act and rectify the issue is also displayed. With this information, it increases the credibility of the Surfrider Peoples 3 Foundation organization and proves that they are truly concerned with the issue that they are presenting to everyday consumers. The Surfrider Foundation has also strategically implemented the appeal to emotion known as pathos. The first image is showing a decomposing seabird with the contents of its stomach consisting of fishing line, bottle caps, and miscellaneous plastic products. If someone is looking at this for the first time, it could open their eyes to an issue that is occurring that they may not have known of. With all the plastic that the seabird ingested, it is appropriate to conclude that the cause of death was from starvation as the seabird did not receive the required nutrients from eating what they believed was food. This can evoke a feeling of guiltiness in the consumer because it can lead them to reflect on their actions with the disposing of plastic products and realize that they may have indirectly caused the death of this animal. This image can also generate a feeling of sadness. The colorful plastic against the earth-tone of the decomposed bird and dirt represents how consumers are living happily in a world with the convenience of disposable plastic products while the consequences of their use are leading to the gloomy deaths of unsuspecting animals. The second image is showing a seal with a scanner to its head and a receipt on the side. The expression on the face is one of someone who is defeated, accepting of their fate, and on the verge of tears. With the scanner undoubtedly representing a gun, this image can lead to the consumer feeling sympathy for the seal. The blurry background and the clarity of the seal emphasis on the seal being held at gunpoint and brings that to the attention of the audience, serving as the main focal point. This can also be an element of kairos, the appeal to timeliness, because if plastic waste continues to enter the ocean, the trigger on the will be pulled, or in other terms, the time will run out. This can also represent that when a consumer buys plastic, they are basically buying the life. The Peoples 4 fact that a human is holding the scanner to the head exemplifies that humans are superior to animals and could be interpreted as consumers only being concerned with their well-being and not the well-being of animals who unfortunately encounter the repercussions of the human benefit of plastic. The Surfrider use of logos is presented through the text on the advertisements. In the first image, the text saying, Above is bright white and larger than any other text on the image. This indicates that Above is the overall message that the Surfrider Foundation is meaning to get across. The brightness and color of the text against the dark, earthy background places more emphasis on this message. It is implied that the Surfrider Foundation chose the words Above for telling consumers to stop using plastic and for adding to the effect that the colorful plastic is rising above the decomposed seabird since, never goes (Center for Biological Diversity). In the second image, there is a dirty, crinkled receipt in the upper left-hand corner. The state of this receipt looks as if it was trash which goes along with the theme of waste. The receipt reads, Buy, the Sea meaning that with every plastic product that is purchased, the sea is going to face negative effects and animal fatalities. This is backed up with the information directly below it that is stating, million tons of plastic packaging waste ends up in the ocean each The Surfrider decision to make a seal the animal affected by this is only logical because it brings truth to the advertisement. According to Sebille, a curious seal, an intact packing band drifting in the water is a serious entanglement (World Economic Forum). Once entangled, the seal suffers a slow death and becomes a casualty from plastic pollution. The receipt also says, Change the Way We inviting and encouraging consumers to support the Surfrider goals. Peoples 5 Both images contribute to the overall importance of the Surfrider goal of ending the use of plastic for disposable convenience and leading it more towards the purpose of reusing. Showing consumers of how plastic pollution is negatively affecting marine animals such as seabirds and seals helps the Surfrider Foundation to gain a supportive audience in changing the way plastic is consumed. These two images represent the concern that the Surfrider Foundation has for the welfare of the marine environment and life that are affected by humans and the pollution that sources from them. To conclude, until the Surfrider Foundation witnesses a change in the consumption of plastic and a significant decrease in the amount of plastic pollution in the ocean, they will continue to create advertisements to persuade consumers to change their mindsets and actions to better the situation. With ethos, pathos, logos, and kairos within their images, the Surfrider Foundation can appeal to their targeted audience and receive more recognition for their efforts.
