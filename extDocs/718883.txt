Sadsad 1 Chrissy Sadsad Kristen Rouisse ENC 1102 16 April 2017 Tree Huggers Enclosed in a block of tall brown and green giants are found everywhere on the University of South campus (About USF). Many students would say that it is the nature of these giants that makes this campus attractive. These giants are trees. Trees are more or less found everywhere and cover a vast amount of this campus and the land. The trees on campus are strategically placed to create a sense of beauty. Though, even majority of not only students but also the population would admire trees for its exquisiteness or the shade it provides; however, there is so much more to what trees offer to the world. While the appreciated trees on campus stand freely with no fear of being harmed, there are endless groups of trees or rather known as forests being cut down. Deforestation is causing a decrease in the tree population and the increase of this action needs to be stopped immediately. Trees are living organisms, and likewise, they are the essence of the life of other species. Thus, because forests are increasingly being ripped from their roots, teenagers need to protest against deforestation in order to protect the last of the forests and continue life around the world. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) is the conservation that works in a hundred countries (World Wildlife Fund). WWF raises awareness universally to protect natural landscapes and inhabitants of such spaces in order to reduce global threats. WWF has six main focuses: marine, freshwater, wildlife, food and (World Wildlife Fund). This organization concentrates on these six areas because this allows WWF to protect Sadsad 2 mostly every aspect of every community around the world. Focusing on forests, WWF claims they are important for oxygen, medicine, food, natural resources such as water and wood, and it is also a home for many. It is clear inhabitants of the earth are dependent on forests for many reasons. Moreover, WWF states, the trees, the ecosystem that supports the human population can fall WWF is doing many things to protect forests, such as, creating influencing funding and policies, stopping illegal and unsustainable acts such as logging, guiding the population on where it is and acceptable to build infrastructure, and helping people become more aware of eating proportions to avoid overconsumption (World Wildlife Fund). Being existent for fifty years, it is evident WWF is a nonviolent organization that simply aims to protect the earth, its resources, and the people. Countless individuals do not consider the significance of forests. While natural disasters do contribute to deforestation, human activity is the primary reason (Ronca 2). are being destroyed at an alarming rate. More and more businessman are pushing through forests to gain land for industrial or commercial purposes. The environment is being sacrificed for the sake of (15+ Phenomenal Ways To Stop Deforestation and Protect Our Planet). Modern society is filled with materialistic people. Such individuals only aspire to be wealthy and some obtain their wealth through the destruction of forests. However, these people tear down forests, do not look for a method of replacing the trees, overlook the future consequences of deforestation and seem to even forget that soon their money will be lost once there are no more trees left. Schwartz states, they still cover about 30 percent of the land area, we lose an area roughly equivalent to the size of Panama in forested land every year. At this rate, there would be no forest left by around 2100. Even where forests are protected on paper, they protected in Schwartz points out the corruption behind keeping track of deforestation and even Sadsad 3 shows people or businesses greediness for trees. Likewise, he signifies if people continue to oversee their actions and how much forest is left in the world, then soon enough all forests will disappear. Furthermore, life is crucial for teenagers. In order to continue human existence, not only forests but also portions of it that contain concentrations of biodiversity (e.g. endangered species) or fragile ecosystems, or areas which are fundamental to meeting basic or traditional cultural needs of local communities (high conservation value must be preserved (RSPO). If such areas of the forests were to be cleared, then this could further endanger the lives of many species, possibly affect various ecosystems due to the loss of life, and could eventually cause future issues for humans. There are countless ways teenagers or any individual can do to push for a free (Solutions to Deforestation). Firstly, one can simply inform others on this particular problem so they are more aware of the effects of deforestation. This will help communities become more educated and hopefully positively modify their mindset towards forests so they can appreciate such areas a little bit more. Donations to WWF or any nonprofit organizations that seek to stop deforestations are also available. Whether donations are small or large, either amount will surely help. Not only can one donate to such organizations, but on the WWF website, becoming a member, joining marches, or even adopting an animal is an option. Moreover, petitions can be created to push for a zero deforestation policy in high biodiversity areas, forest conservation rules in order to stop the behind the scenes corruption, or transform businesses into green companies by making them produce sustainable products. Additionally, a process known as reforestation can take place. Reforestation is the procedure of planting more trees in renewed fertile landscapes (Ronca 4). Individuals can similarly start to make informed choices about products and aim to only purchase those that are forest-friendly; by doing so, Sadsad 4 corporations may start to see a decline in their sales, figure out why, and perhaps aim to manufacture only forest-friendly merchandises. These are not the only ways teenagers and other individuals can support forests, there are so many other methods of creating a better future for the tree population. In conclusion, deforestation has been a significant problem for many years and for many reasons. hold value that exists beyond use by anybody or anything, just by their very nature as forests. We risk all of it as we let them (Schwartz). This value forests hold is clearly not taken seriously or into consideration. If forests were to continue to disappear then there is a probability that all ecosystems would die out (Sustainable palm oil). small step by you, leads to twenty or more giant leaps towards a global campaign against (15+ Phenomenal Ways To Stop Deforestation and Protect Our . Even just a single individual can make a huge difference and positively influence forests and their peers. Though, teenagers are the generation to be. This group can revolutionize deforestation and live it out to the end to witness the modifications made. However, some type of action must be done now, or rather sooner than later before it is too late because the few forests that are left are rapidly disappearing. Striving for a deforestation-free future and pursuing with the multiple calls to actions offered, will without doubt help reduce the negative impacts on the environment and prevent the extinction of life.
