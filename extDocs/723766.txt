Student 1 Student Professor Gaspar ENC 1102 16 April 2017 How GMOs can impact your lives for the better In our daily lives, everyone has something in that their lives revolve around and that is food. Everyone needs food to survive and live, without it we will not live that long. The main difference that people have with food is how they get it, like how it is produced, manufactured, or cultivated. In the traditional way of farming, the farmers plant the seeds and take care of the crops, hoping to get lucky with the yield they get and regrew the ones that prospered the best. They would continue growing the ones that produced the best results and are beneficial, also known as selective breeding. Selective breeding is a form of simple genetic engineering, where the person determines what the desired trait is by appearance of the organism and breed that organism with another similar one to continue the trait. Nowadays, genetically-modified organisms, or commonly known as GMOs, are a more common way of getting the specific trait of the organism. Certain organisms, like farm animals and crops, are genetically altered to produce a higher yield and be more efficient. Genetic engineering is used in other fields of science, besides farming and agriculture, like medicine. People are not concerned about genetic engineering in medicine and other medical areas but are view GMOs as harming and unsafe in agriculture and food industries. Genetic engineering is just a more complicated version of selective breeding; in selective breeding, it is based on luck, while in genetic engineering, there more of a choice and do not have to rely on luck to get the best outcomes. There are several advantages to using GMOs that make life simpler and better. GM (genetically-modified) crops Student 2 can produce a higher yield and have a more favorable outcome than non-GM crops. GM crops also have built-in pesticide and resistance, and require less harmful chemicals for protection than non-GM crops. There is also the argument that farmers lose out on jobs because GMOs however they actually benefit more from GM crops. Also, GM crops can grow in places that non-GM crops would not be able to grow in. Main argument against the use of GMOs is that people believe that GMOs are toxic and are harmful to humans and the environment. However, through thorough studies and experiments, it was determined that GM crops have the same amount risk as non-GM crops (Domingo, 2011). That means that GM crops are not dangerous to be consumed since they are on the same level as and crops. selected original research papers, reviews, relevant opinions and reports addressing all the major issues that emerged in the debate on GE crops, trying to catch the scientific consensus that has matured since GE plants became widely cultivated worldwide. The scientific research conducted so far has not detected any significant hazards directly connected with the use of GE crops; however, the debate is still intense (Nicolia et al Many scientists and researchers have gone through reports, studies, experiments, and researches to determine that GM crops propose any real threats to humans and the environment. Normally, crops are sprayed with pesticides to provide protection and resistance against insects and other organisms that would be harmful against the crop. However, in GMOs, a gene is inserted in the genetically engineered plants that is taken from the bacterium Bacillus Thuringenesis, which lets the plants to make protein that destroys the digestive system of the insects that it specifies (Niederhuber This a way of the plant making its own pesticides instead of having to spray chemicals onto the plant for insect resistance, like on non-GM plants. People might be concerned that the poison, or pesticide, would be harmful for Student 3 humans but there is no reason to worry since the pesticide is target specific and is safe towards humans and bad against unwanted insects. The negative side effects of the use of pesticides on plants are that they can be very expensive and can be harmful for farmers if they are exposed to it for a while.
