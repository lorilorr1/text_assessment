Jessica Parker ENG 1101 Uddin Trans-Pacific Partnership The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) was created with the goal of binding Pacific nations by offering low tariffs and protecting the global economy from rapid economic growth and influence. What started out as a trade agreement between New Zealand, Singapore, Chile and Brunei, called the P-4, soon became the TPP when the United States announced its join in February 2008 under Bush presidency. One of the original reasons for act to join was to be recognized in the Annual Report on Trade Agreements. This report stated the TPP could give the opportunity for big US businesses to better their competition in the Asia- Pacific region; which was at a noticeably high exclusion rate as economy was developing. Soon the TPP was to become the largest regional trade agreement, consisting of Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam and the United States. These countries put together contained roughly 40% of the global GDP and 1/3 of the world trade. Through the years of involvement with the TPP, saw no new jobs or major direct impact. Some big businesses had larger yearly exports to international low paying manufacturing jobs which limited competition and even raised prices on certain items. In the recent election of President Trump, the US resigned from its involvement with the TPP. With the past involvement and recent resignation, did the TPP have a positive impact on the United economy? Jessica Parker ENG 1101 Uddin Source 1 Cheney, Glenn A. U.S. Trade Policy: Is The Dozing Giant  Financial Executive 26.4 (2010): 18-21. Business Abstracts with Full Text (H.W. Wilson). Americans have transferred most of their disposable income into savings causing American companies to rely on the oversea economies and markets. While in office, President Barack Obama stated an initiative to become more involved in foreign affairs, create more jobs for Americans and promised to double exports in 5 years. As the new government proceeded, foreign tariffs were on the rise and exports were stagnant. With the trans-pacific partnership, countries in need of overseas trade would be able to build those foreign relationships. The trade will be centered on the major markets of the world, including the rising economy of China. With the fall of the economy in 2008, the TPP was signed to increase economic growth and jobs in the US to fulfill 5 year initiative. This relates to my research question in asking if signing on to the TPP was beneficial to our economy. A 15% increase each year is a huge initiative and jobs were still not being found after the join. This article Trade Policy: Is the dozing giant came from the Financial Executives International website, www.financialexecutives.org. Glenn A. Cheney writes frequently for the Financial Executive focusing around topics of business, finance, accounting and tax. Jessica Parker ENG 1101 Uddin Source 2 Ravenhill*, John. The Move To Preferential Trade On The Western Pacific Rim: Some Initial  Australian Journal Of International Affairs 62.2 (2008): 129-150. Humanities Source. The United States saw how preferential trade agreements were integrating themselves permanently into the global trade economy. The US is the most comprehensive with world trade organizations when it comes to trading goods and services. The FTA made under the Clinton and Bush administrations were seen more as loyal rather than expanding trade and achieving economic growth. However, making it a priority to trade with did not result in lack of economic objectives. Ultimately there are three motivations of the trade negotiations being deeper integration, secure access to raw materials, and defensive motivations. Looking at the three motivations of trade agreements, the United States have other motivations besides what they tell the people. This relates to my research question because the U.S. had other motivations besides continuing to have a prospering economy. No matter how the TPP affected the economy, the U.S. was always going to gain something. With the growing China economy during the time of the growing TPP agreements, countries including the US did not just want to achieve economic growth in their country, but gain an economically growing ally.

In September 2008, the US announced it would join the TPP with the goal of combining existing trades between Asia-Pacific countries including Australia, Vietnam, Thailand, Chile, Brunei, Singapore and New Zealand. Trade associations such as the Emergency Committee for American Trade, the National American of Manufacturers, and the American Farm Bureau Federations have shown concern in the negative affects it could have on previous negotiations made between specific countries. Singapore was included as one of these countries due to the labor and New competitive dairy and beef industries. administration delayed joining the TPP which some saw as considering the opposing opinions of the other trade associations. Aside from considering the prospering economy and growing job opportunities, I found this article very interesting as it opened up a whole new aspect of trade policies. Previous articles looked at how the TPP affected job and economic growth. This relates to my research question because joining the TPP or any trade agreement could cause controversy in other trade agreements which could affect the U.S. economy. When considering what agreements to join, there are many factors affecting the economy and trade opportunities.

With the official signing in 2015, the provisions were to address trade issues, international investment, intellectual property, currency policy, and many aspects of domestic economic regulation, including labor rights and environmental protection. administration goal was to strengthen the economy and international interests in certain parts of the world, and the TPP promised these opportunities. If the U.S. had not joined the TPP, China would have had a faster growing economy and integrated itself more in trade worldwide. With the joining, the TPP made economic ties with the U.S. and other countries stronger and supportive. In this article, U.S. joining the TPP was a positive thing for the Obama administration. It strengthened ties and helped integrate the U.S. into growing economy. The TPP allowed access to gain allies for the United States as well as participating in a trade agreement containing 1/3 of the world trade and 40% of the global GDP. Signing this deal gave the U.S. a large portion of legal power, as they were the largest economy in the agreement. This relates to my research question because having a large portion of legal power, the US could make decisions that would best benefit them economically.
