Chris Barr Professor Ricketts ENC 1101 5 March 2017 Student athletes on college performance In the United States there are 4,140 colleges and universities. (Beron and Piquero) Many of these schools have athletic programs. Student athletes are a diverse population within most of these colleges/ universities and many of these student athletes are held to a different standard compared to the student body. Student athletes and regular students have the same requirement academically such as receiving passing grades, but the difference is the extracurricular activities that athletes are required to participate in. Most athletes schedule consists of practicing, lifting weights, conditioning, film studying, and competing in games. Due to this many researchers have began to study college athletes on academic performance. In the past 17 years researchers came to a concise agreement regarding student athletes academic performance, which is that any many cases athletes academic performance is not affected by participating in athletics. There has been no change in the scholarly conversation in student athletes academic performance, due to National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) requirements for student athletes. In the early 2000s there was many studies being conducted that analyzed student academic performance. In 2006, a research studied student athletes and came to the conclusion that these athletes are not different from the regular student body( Umbach &. Palmer). In the article Athletes and Effective Educational Practices: Winning Combination or Losing Paul Umbach and Megan Palmer stated, Student-athletes across a large number of colleges and universities do not differ greatly from their peers in terms of their participation in effective educational According to the article Well-Being and Sport-Related Identities in College students has been identify to diagnoses with depression and it is increasingly growing in the United States. Study conducted by Joseph Hoffman and Kathleen Miller in 2009 shows student athletes have a lower rate of depression and suicide because of physical activities (335). Another study shows that female athletes are at higher risk than male to attempt committing suicide the ratio is female three times as likely as a male. All of these studies have contributed to the scholarly conversation because they consist of the same topic but different aspects of the topic . In the late 2000s there was a scholarly conversation about student athletes academic performance in academic on the collegiate level. In 2016, Kurt Beron and Alex Piquero did a study to find out was there a difference from female vs. male on there academic success. According to Beron and Piquero, studies found no statistical differences in athletic or academic identity across division and sex. These results show that there is no difference between the genders and division, so all athletes should be held to the same standards. Analyses were conducted for the revenue-producing sports. Results. GPA is directly by their athletic versus academic identity, the athletic context including the and the seriousness with which they view academics. Cross-equation joint testing found no statistical differences in athletic or academic identity across division and sex (142). Another discussion researcher wanted to research high school student athletes transitioning to college there freshman year. The authors Discusses ACT/ SAT predictors for how well student athletes will perform in college. According to Multilevel Multivariate Analysis of Academic Performances in College Based on NCAA The multilevel results show that (a) high school grades are the best available predictors of freshman college grades, (b) the ACT and SAT test scores are the next best predictors available, (c) the number of high school core units taken does not add to this prediction but does predict credits attained, (d) college graduation rate has a second-level effect of a small negative outcome on the average grades, and (e) nonlinear models indicate stronger effects for students at higher levels of the academic variables(57). Academic coordinators and coaches can use these predictors to understand if the high school student is suitable for the school academic principles. Work cited Beron, Kurt J.1, and Piquero, Alex R.1.
