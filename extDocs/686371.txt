Castillano 1 Sharae Castillano Professor Sarah Roth Composition 1 March 23 2017 Predicting the Future: The Changing Scholarly Conversation of Divination and Tarot Tarot cards are a deck which includes 78 cards that contain 22 Major Arcana cards and 56 Minor Arcana cards. Each card represents something and are usually used to predict the future. Divination is the practice of seeking knowledge of the future or the unknown by supernatural means. There are various types of divination such as astrology, palmistry, and the Ouija boards. But there is one both popular and controversial; Tarot cards. Tarot cards are known to be a divination tool and came about in the early 1400s in Northern Italy. Tarot cards have hundreds of different interpretations, which is why one card can mean several different things for multiple people. These cards are a taboo subject, but how curious are you about your future? If there was an opportunity to get a tarot card reading, would you peek into your future? People have gone from not speaking about tarot to bringing it into their lives as a way to clear a path in their own lives. In this project, I investigate all the factors that may or may not lead one to take an interest in tarot cards and how the perspectives have changed over time. In 2002, a report was done on tarot history. The oldest set of tarot cards, one of the originals, left remaining is called the Visconti-Sforza deck and was made for the Duke of family around 1440. They were originally called taracchi cards which are two sets of fifty 15 th century Italian prints. The game was spread throughout Europe until it was eventually called tarot and then later used to predict future. Further into the 18 th century, it is said that Castillano 2 a man named Antoine Court de Gebeline wrote a book connecting tarot cards to a god called Thoth. As time passed, many have turned to tarot. History is very important when it comes to learning about something new and it can play a big part about whether one wants to learn about something or not. When it comes to tarot cards, anyone, whether a businessman or office clerk, can be involved with them; just as in the past when it was a game called Tarachhi, anyone could play. In 2015, Barbara Herman interviews and writes about Angeliska Polacheck of Sister Temperance Tarot which is the name of her shop/company. This article is Polacheck explaining the history of tarot cards and how she became a tarot card reader. Getting a tarot card reading from Polacheck just about her clients getting easy answers about their future. She wants them to put in work in their readings and have input.

With her shop/company, Polacheck could and has peaked interest in quite a bunch of people from all over the world. She has had a lot of people who would much rather visit her than a therapist and has had even one client who said that Polacheck the most beautiful and loving and is than therapy and twice as If people are more comfortable going to a tarot card reader than a therapist, it can influence others to do the same. In the 2002 article, tarot went from a game to a divination tool and it still can be used as both today, but in the 2015 article it is only used as a divination tool. Both perspectives become similar when they speak of who can use them. With both, anyone can use or be associated with tarot. Just as water just for drinking, tarot cards used only for fortune telling. In 2005, the subject of tarot when towards the many different uses of tarot cards. Tarot cards can be used to meditate and tells us about our past and present, and much more. This gives the tarot Castillano 3 cards many different functions and meanings. As far as religion goes, most religions say not to get your fortune told. What about being told about your present or even past? Though there are these different uses for tarot cards, many religions forbid it completely. With Christianity, to be specific, the Bible condemns divination on a whole. Kresley series in 2012, Arcana includes mostly the Major Arcana which consists of 22 tarot cards. In the book, the 22 Major Arcana are in a war repeatedly, but every time the war happens, they forget who they are. The main character, Evangeline Greene, is in a sort of a trance. In the beginning of the book she thinks crazy for having visions of the apocalypse until it happens and more than half of the world is wiped out. Throughout the book, another character/love interest, Jackson Deveaux, vows to protect her and carry her to her house because her grandmother tried to teach her of the tarot cards when she was young; she was forced to forget her teachings. Her grandmother was trying to prepare her for the war that was to come with the Major Arcana. Although there are some that are skeptical about tarot, most are either for or against them. The topics discussed in the 2005 article and 2012 book are completely different. The 2005 article speaks of different ways to use tarot cards like for meditating and getting to know self while the 2012 book gives a whole imaginative perspective of tarot. They both use or gives images of a different side of tarot and the perspectives are both the same and different as time passed. In world, tarot is more than often used for fortune telling, but as time passed it has evolved and been created into different things through perspectives. Tarot was originally a game made into a divination tool and then used as a healing/entertainment tool.
