Kelsey Lay Lay 1 Instructor: Emil Smith Composition 1101/002 April 9, 2017 Dangers of Adderall Adderall is a combination of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine which are central nervous system stimulants that affect chemicals in the brain and nerves that contribute to hyperactivity and impulse control. Psychiatrists prescribe this drug to treat people with Attention Deficit Disorder with or without hyperactivity (ADHD or ADD). These conditions make a person either unable to focus or unable to control their impulses. It is prescribed to over 2.5 million people in the United States each year. As this may be an alarming number of people who use Adderall, the number of people who use Adderall and do not need it is alarmingly higher. The most common abusers are college students. Students who are prescribed Adderall can make a profit by selling their unused drugs to other college students who have not been diagnosed with ADD or ADHD. College students especially around final exam time seek these pills to help them study and pull all-nighters to get end of the year projects done. Other students who are normally shy want to use the pills because they feel they make them more talkative and likeable amongst their fellow students. These students do not feel they are doing anything wrong taking these pills and feel invisible against any potential harm. The truth is nonprescribed medical Adderall is both dangerous and addictive. Most college students who take Adderall without a prescription argue that they are not doing anything wrong and that the drugs are harmless. A study was done by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) in 2007, 175 undergraduate students (94 males, 81 females, 13 non-Caucasian) in a large, public southeastern urban United States research Lay 2 university determined that most students believed the use of Adderall was both physically harmless and morally acceptable. Students believe that Adderall is a study drug which will help them focus and be more attentive to their schoolwork. They argue there is no harm in taking the drug if they only take it occasionally to help them with studying and testing. Adderall is believed to be a study enhancer, an educational beneficial stimulant. Researcher John Goodman agreed with the college students to a degree in his article, Cognitive Enhancement, Cheating and Accomplishment, by stating Adderall is acceptable and harmless if only taken to focus on (145) Students believe these stimulants will help them study but are of no risk to their health since they are federally regulated. E.A. Kolek stated in his article, Recreational prescription drug use among college students, students are under the impression that since ADHD stimulants are produced, regulated, and prescribed by the medical community, the drugs are not potentially addictive and harmful for their (529) However, Adderall has been shown to not only to be dangerous to a college students but highly addictive. As the number of college students using nonprescribed Adderall continues to rise so do the risks associated with taking the drug illegally. In the last 10 years, the use of nonprescribed Adderall has risen from 12 million persons to 21 million persons. Various studies have been conducted on college campuses and the abuse rate ranges from 7% to 33% among these students. Per Larry Kroutil in Nonmedical Use of Prescription Stimulants in the United States, 18-25 years old, in which this age group was 10 times more likely than any other age group to misuse Adderall (137-138). Researcher have found that the characteristics of the users who are using the stimulant without a prescription tend to be male, white, middle to high income families, members of fraternities or sororities, and students with a grade point average of a B or lower. This trend increases the danger of Adderall since many students are taking the drug not Lay 3 only as a study drug but as a drug to heighten effects of alcohol and create a high or euphoria. Between 2005 and 2010 emergency room visits from the effect of nonprescribed Adderall has tripled going from 5,212 reported cases in the United States to 15,585 reported cases. Those involving adverse reactions has grown from 5,085 visits to 9,181 visits. This causes great concern for the Drug Administration and medical professionals. The medical risks associated with taking Adderall without a prescription are very alarming. The use of this stimulant has been reported to cause central nervous system adverse effects, circulatory and respiratory system effects, digestive system effects and skin issues. The central nervous system is affected because the stimulant speeds up the bodily process. This speed up can cause symptoms such as nervousness, headaches, moodiness, fever, weakness in limbs, swelling of tongue, and in severe cases hallucinations, paranoia and thought problems. The speed up of the nervous system causes problems with the circulatory and respiratory system. Reactions can be numbness in the limbs, shortness of breath, fainting high blood pressure, increase in speed of heartbeat, heart attacks, stroke and in extreme case sudden death. Adderall affects the digestive system by increasing the amount of glucose released in the system. This may cause stomach pain, diarrhea, vomiting, loss of appetite and weight loss. Adderall may also cause a person to develop skin issues such as hives, rashes, and blisters. The stimulant might seem harmless to the college student but the risks are numerous and should not be ignored. Another serious risk of Adderall is mixing the drug with alcohol to create a high that students have compared to a cocaine high. When students take a stimulant with alcohol the drug dulls the symptoms of being drug which leads to a high risk of alcohol poisoning. Alcohol poisoning can cause death. Mixing also creates a high risk of heart problems, increase in body temperature, increased heart rate, irregular heartbeat, and increase blood pressure. These can lead to heart Lay 4 attacks and sudden death. Lastly, alcohol and Adderall can cause behavioral issues such as aggressive behavior. This can a lead a person to do something that they may not normally do that may land them in jail. The high someone might feel from mixing alcohol and Adderall does not outweigh the risks associated. Lastly, the nonprescribed medical use of Adderall can lead to drug addiction. The National Drug Administration has categorized Adderall as a schedule II drug. This classification of drug means that the drugs in this group have a high potential for abuse. The drug has a currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions. Abuse of this drug may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence. The use of Adderall increase the levels of dopamine levels in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that helps control the reward and pleasure system. This chemical tends to create a euphoria in the abuser that increases the chances of a chemical dependence thus leading to addiction. The brain becomes dependent on Adderall to stimulate alertness and to create a high feeling. These feelings of euphoria and high feeling can lead to a dangerous drug addiction. Drug addiction is a chronic disease and over time causes the brain to change and challenges a self-control and interferes with their ability to resist a drug and the feeling they get from taking the drug. The addict seeks and takes the drug without concern for the possible harmful consequences. A drug addiction can cause serious medical issues, social issues, and issues with the law. Adderall is a drug that is highly addictive if taken when not medically necessary. As the nonprescribed medical use of Adderall continues to increase of college students so do the dangers and possible addiction associated with this schedule II drug. Students may believe that the drug is harmless to take as a study aid, but scientific research shows that this is far from the truth. There are severe medical and psychological risks associated with the abuse of Adderall. Lay 5 Students need to be educated on the risks of taking the so called Adderall is a highly addictive and dangerous and should not be taken without proper medical care and a proper evaluation from an educated doctor.
