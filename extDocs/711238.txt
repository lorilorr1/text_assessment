Crawford 1 Chloe Crawford Professor Missler 04/16/17 Lifetime safety in the sanctuary Have you ever been to a Zoo? Yes, is the most common answer to this question just because of the fact that there are over 10,00 zoos worldwide. A zoo is an establishment that maintains a collection of wild animals, typically in a park and or gardens, for study, conservation, or display to the public. The previously stated definition is how zoos want the public to view them, however that is not the reality that they hold for their animals. Zoo realities includes confined spaces for the rest of their lives, depressed moods and severe anxiety that most visitors and viewers necessarily aware of. In order to stop the suffering that these animals have and take action to this concerning and important issue, we can stop supporting zoos by one not attending them, and two by visiting an animal sanctuary instead. An animal sanctuary is a facility where animals are brought to live and be protected for the rest of their lives. Showing and illustrating the reality that zoos provide for the animals will motivate others including you do take action and to do something about this important issue. Animals sadly suffer in zoos. By being confined to small spaces, animals able to perform their basic abilities which is in a sense taking away their rights as an animal. According to Clare McClausland author of Five Freedoms of Animal Welfare are says that to express normal is included in animal rights (651). Being in those confined spaces animals able to express nor perform their basic behaviors. Zoos cannot provide the amount of space that animals in the wild have. Statistics from the Captive Animals Protection Crawford 2 Society displays this as well. and lions have around 18,000 times less space in a zoo than they would in the wild, and Polar bears have one million times less Nothing can compare to the ample and abundant amount of space animals in the wild have, however those statistics prove how animals provide sufficient spacing for their animals. Being in those confined spaces animals able to express nor perform their basic behaviors as an animal. Which then leads the zoos providing false information to the public. claim to provide reliable and credible information and education for the people that come and visit however not much to observe from an animal when not in its natural habitat or in a similar replica of it. An example are birds, most birds at zoos have their wings clipped so they cannot fly. When an animal in the proper living conditions, nor can do or perform their basic performance (like flying for a bird), the animal will act differently. These unnatural state and conditions zoos hold their animals in lead to zoo animals suffering. Zoo animals suffer from a variety of things including depression, anxiety, and which then lead to abnormal behaviors. Since the zoo animals are deprived of ample amounts of space to house them these animals illustrate abnormal behaviors. According to the article Zoos: Pitiful Prisons are closely confined, lack of privacy, and have little opportunity for mental stimulation or physical exercise. These conditions often result in abnormal and self-destructive behavior, known as One abnormal behavior that zoo animals do that is the most vivid to the average zoo attender is the pacing that some animals have. According to the Captive Animals Protection Society, lions spend forty-eight percent of their time pacing. almost half of their time alive, spent pacing by the same view, in the same cage for the rest of their lives. How tragic. now understandable on how and why most zoo animals suffer from depression. Zoo animals only suffer from depression, but also from anxiety. Some animals are forced to Crawford 3 perform for entertainment on a daily basis. Also some zoo animals are stressed out by screaming zoo visitors banging on their exhibit. All of these examples illustrate how these animals suffer from being in a being housed and confined to a zoo. Fortunately, there is a way to still experience, and visit exotic animals up close and not attend nor support a zoo. You can do this by attending and or donating to an animal sanctuary instead. According to Ben Callison the CEO and president of the Humane Society of Wildlife land Trust, animals need sanctuaries. An animal sanctuary is a place where formerly neglected animals from zoos, circuses, and parks go to. Callison considers animal sanctuaries a haven where they can live the remainder of their lives in peace and Animal sanctuaries have ample amount of space to house their animals and visitors are welcome to view. The Wild Animal Sanctuary has over seven hundred and twenty acres of land to house their animals, and visitors are able to walk the into the walk on their panoramic walkway right over the acreage habitats these animals live freely in. This natural replica of the environment is similar to the wild. While the average zoo habitat only a couple feet to house the animal for a majority of their life. You can also support animal sanctuaries by donating to (people for the ethical treatment of animals) organization or at any sanctuary, online or in person. important to take a look at the image of zoo in a deeper intellect. evident on how zoo animals suffer in that environment. This is why it is so important and necessary to take action to this important issue. The wild animal sanctuary beautifully says how we can truly make a difference, one animal may not change the world, but surely-for that one animal the world will change Crawford 4 Works Cited Callison, Ben.
