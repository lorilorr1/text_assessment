Bora 1 Marcel Bora Professor Drugan ENC 1102 29 January 2017 Intermediate Draft Zoos are a great source of entertainment for many people. The same cannot be said for the animals that these zoos contain. In the past few years, animal rights activist groups have been working to attempt to close zoos and free the animals back to their environments because of the mistreatment and unethicalness of containing animals far from their natural habitats. Companies owning these zoos and some conservationists wish to keep the zoos open for both business and the benefit of being able to help some species come back from being endangered. To find a compromise one must look at both sides of the argument and to choose the best option that will not fully please either side but it creates a far more beneficial outcome that one side winning. The stakeholders on one side that wish for animals to be completely removed from all zoos and captivity are usually animal rights groups. Two such groups are People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA, and Companion Animal Protection Society, or CAPS. There has been extensive research into the care that the animals are actually receiving in zoos and whether or not it is healthy to keep animals that are meant to be roaming out in the world in small cages. Conservation is an issue that they wish to help with but they view that zoos are doing it the wrong way by taking away this freedom. As Keulartz states in his essay, consider infringing an right to freedom for the sake of the preservation of the species as morally (Keulartz 338). Another view could be is the point of preserving animals if they are having miserable (Keulartz 340). Bora 2 The other stakeholders, the conservationists that believe that zoos are necessary to preserve animals, and companies owning the zoos would prefer to keep zoos open. The Zoo owners obviously wish to keep the zoos open for their business and because some enjoy their jobs. Closing the zoos would also create a large unemployed population. The conservationists, as explained above, would prefer to keep zoos open for the purpose of healing animals and ensuring that an endangered species does not go extinct. Zoos could also be viewed as bringing awareness to the public by having live animals right in front of them rather than viewing that animal on a television or computer. Many of these stakeholders see that people tend to protect what they value, zoo experiences can and do provide new generations of (Skibins & Powell). A compromise can be reached between these two stakeholders. What can be proposed is harsher restrictions on zoos and for the owners and caretakers to take care of the animals better. The zoos would not be able to buy and trade animals with high stress levels and to ensure that if an animal can be returned to the natural habitat where it belongs, that it should. The zoos should focus on conservation and helping the animals rather than focus on entertainment. This is already in effect but many zoos do not follow these procedures and these restrictions and requirements should ensure for better treatment of the animals and for more of them to be released to the wild. This compromise benefits both stakeholders and, most importantly, that animals that these people are fighting over. Bora 3 Works Cited Cohn, Jeffrey P.
