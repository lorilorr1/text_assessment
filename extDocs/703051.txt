Watts 1 Mitchell Watts Professor Van Winkle ENC 1102 9 April 2017 Join the Mothers Against Videogame Addiction and Violence organization The twentieth century has evolved in terms of technology in so many ways, including video games. Have you noticed how many kids play video games, whether it is apps on their phones, or games on consoles, such as Xbox or Play Station? Graphics have improved, there are more game modes, and violence is usually included. Eighty five percent of video games that are being sold contain some form of violence (Scutti, CNN, July 26, 2016). Some popular games are Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto, Halo, and Battlefield. This must be what kids enjoy, violence, but violent video games can have negative effects on children and it has been proven. Nowadays, kids sit inside more often, because they are addicted to video games instead of getting exercise and playing sports. Parents, you probably notice a difference in your child after they play violent video games. Join the Mothers Against Videogame Addiction and Violence program to help keep your kids and others away from violent video games and the negative effects that come with them. Violence can come in many different ways when it comes to video games. This includes guns, blood, death, abusive language, and much more. Violent games are such a bad influence on kids. They show success through murder, they can show disrespect towards women, sexual content is included, and many games have inappropriate language (St. John, Laura, 2016). Everyone knows that many kids enjoy video games, but parents need to be knowledgeable about the games that their children are playing. Advancement in technology has made kids more Watts 2 interested in playing video games. One hundred fifty five million Americans play video games regularly and four out of five households contain a video game console of some kind (Lofgren, 2016). It is sad to hear that parents are helping their kids get violent games when their kids are not old enough to play them. Also, workers should not allow under age kids to buy games that are over their age limit. Games are rated appropriately, so that parents and kids know if they should play those games or not. The National Institute on Media and the Family were a part of fifty eight operations and figured out that about half the time twelve year olds could buy M rated games, or Mature rated games that are for people seventeen or older (Tapper, 2007). Parents really need to care about these ratings. The Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB) sets ratings for games and they take violence into account. Another study, consisted of asking 1,221 parents of children that are seventeen years old if they cared about what kinds of games they played. About sixty four percent of these parents stated that they did not care. Fifty five percent thought that age restrictions did not matter (Hick, 2012). Even the American Psychological Association thinks there is a correlation between aggressive behavior and children that play violent games as reported in August of 2015 (Albanese Jr., 2015). Parents should care about what kinds of video games their kids play, because if they play violent video games they can be negatively affected by them. It is important to recognize the symptoms of how kids can be affected by violent video games. Symptoms include violent behavior, pretending to be violent characters from the games, staying indoors, poor grades, altercations with teachers, and getting into fights with other children (pamf.org). Most parents should care about how their decisions and actions. That is why joining the MAVAV can help educate parents about violent video games as well as spread information to others, so that they can join. Poor decisions can also involve murder. Not virtual video game murder, real life Watts 3 murder. A recent event included an eighteen year old gunman who killed nine people in Munich, Germany. He was known to have liked first person shooter video games (Scutti, CNN, July 26, 2016). Another concern, is how violent video games are being promoted by companies that have nothing to do with the gaming industry, such as restaurants. is an example of this. promoted a violent video game called Manhunt 2 by coming up with a meal plan for kids. This included changing the logo from a harmless little girl to something disturbing. The head of the girl was on top of a muscular male body, which included red eyes, tattoos, hatchets, and guns (mavav.org). Restaurants should not alter their logo to make it look scary, especially not to help promote violence.
