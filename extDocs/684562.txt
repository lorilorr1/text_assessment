Alexis Campisi Professor Uddin Composition 1 3/12/2017 Animal Testing Animal testing is the process of using a living animal subject for experiments and tests on products later to be used for humans or pets. For years animals have been used for cosmetics, such as makeup and perfumes, and medicine, such as cures and vaccines for dogs and cats. In past years there has been controversies about if testing on animals should be allowed or not, even just for medical use. Most scholars have agreed that this practice should be allowed for medicinal reasons, while the minority has said that the practice is just too dangerous for both humans and animals. Earlier this decade there have been multiple academic journals containing information about the continuation of animal testing, most of them containing the preference to keep it to continue research for medical cures and other reasons. In the article Why animal experimentation matters by Ellen Frankel Paul written in 2002, it states animal testing deadly viruses like rabies and yellow fever could have become modern versions of the Black Death, and our knowledge about human health and physiology would have been drastically meaning without our testing on animals for the sake of humans and other animals vaccines and cures, viruses could have spread much more quickly and become a lot more deadly. Another article simply states It is logical to assume that for therapies against bacterial, fungal or viral infections the translation from animals to man is more likely to be Also meaning that the transition from animal to man is the most likely thing to work beside working on the human kind itself. Another article from 2005 called Testing drugs on animals: A test case for socially responsible investment, has a slightly differing opinion deep within the long academic journal. It questions what is morally right when it comes to these things, stating it is accepted that animal testing makes a positive contribution to the development of new drugs, the moral question that arises is whether the furtherance of human health and the saving of human lives justify the use of animals in the development of medical , meaning that if animal testing is to be accepted for medical uses, would people in the world be able to face the fact that killing and abusing living beings to make the world better for human kind? On the other hand, later in the decade, more towards the present date there has been more journals written on this pressing matter. As the years go by, one article called Background to animal testing written in 2017 explains how violent people who believe this practice should be stopped have become. It states to researchers and their families left some of the more prominent ones requiring bodyguards for and a similar incident from 2007, a bomb was actually placed under a car but fortunately, the bomb had a faulty fuse and nobody was , meaning that people believe that this practice should be stopped so badly that willing to threaten and even try to kill others who participate in animal testing. Another academic journal from this decade includes a paragraph explaining what the author thinks will become of the future for this practice. It states that there will likely never be an end to the animal rights activists efforts to stop the practice, but as the years go on, a new medium might become available, and animal testing will likely lessen and lessen as years go on. But in an ideal world there would be the perfect substitute for the practice. In the last two decades there been much change in the journals written about the practice known as animal testing. All writers from both decades seem to have same similar conclusions when It comes to the idea of it: that it should be continued for medicinal reasons. Whether that be cures for the human race, or a differing animal species. One thing is for certain when it comes to the fight between should it be continued and should it not be continued, and that is that over the years, the animal rights activists have become increasingly more violent as their passion increases for the end of this practice. But, after reading academic journals and looking at professors and researchers information on the subject, it is clear that without testing on animals, human kind would have gone through many dark ages, and much more diseases would have been spread.
