Pawelec 1 Jakub Pawelec Ms. Tisdale ENC 1101 Sec. 017 12 Feb 2017 Do Smartphones Help or Hinder Productivity? During the last 10 years, smartphones have become one of the most important tools to make people more productive in their daily lives. Smartphones today have many capabilities like GPS navigation to guide people to their destinations, messaging applications to communicate with people around the world, and even the capability to purchase and display airplane tickets. Smartphones have basically become small computers that can be kept in a pocket. However, smartphones have also become a distraction, possibly hurting productivity more than helping it. Smartphones can both improve and hinder productivity depending on the type of workplace setting. et al. Modelling Smartphone Addiction: The Role Of Smartphone Usage, Self-Regulation, General Self-Efficacy And Cyberloafing In University  Computers In Human Behavior 63 (2016): 639-649. Education Source. Web. 28 Jan. 2017 study investigates the causes of smartphone addiction as well as the effects of smartphone addiction on the academic performance of college students. This study was performed on 614 undergraduate students at a university in Ankara with about half of the participants being in their first year at the university and the other half including second, third, and fourth year students. This study was conducted in the form of a 15 minute questionnaire sent out by email. Pawelec 2 The results of this study found that smartphone addiction naturally increased as smartphone usage increased. In addition, the study found that addiction might limit an ability to communicate with his family and immediate Furthermore, this study found smartphones to have a negative effect on academic performance. Cyberloafing, which is defined by the authors as using smartphones in class for purposes not related to class, was also found to increase smartphone addiction. This study shows that increasing smartphone addiction caused the grades of college students to drop.

Mobile And More Productive? Firm-Level Evidence On The Productivity Effects Of Mobile Internet  Telecommunications Policy 40.(2016): 888-898. ScienceDirect. Web. 28 Jan. 2017. The authors of this study analyzed data from a massive survey of German businesses conducted in 2010 and 2014 about technology used by these businesses. In particular, business- provided mobile internet device usage by employees was the main variable studied from this survey. The data showed that business provided mobile device usage doubled from 2010 to 2014. The data also showed that businesses that had provided employees with mobile devices had much higher productivity than those businesses that did not. The study also shows the gains in productivity outweighed the difficulty of monitoring employees and the possible distraction from smartphones. This study was conducted by members of a European research center and published in a peer reviewed journal. Yun, Haejung, William J. Kettinger, and Choong C. Lee. A New Open Door: The Impact On Work-To-Life Conflict, Stress, And  International Journal Of Pawelec 3 Electronic Commerce 16.4 (2012): 121-152. Business Source Premier. Web. 28 Jan. 2017. This study observed the role of smartphones in the workplace environment and how they affect productivity in the workplace. It also looked at work-to-life conflict and its effect on productivity. Work-to-life conflict in this study was defined to be effect on family as well as effect on general life outside of work like hobbies. This study was conducted through an email survey to 3,000 randomly selected smartphone users. The findings of the study show that smartphones do increase productivity in the workplace. However, they also increase the perception of work overload and create additional work-to-life conflict due to the increased flexibility offered by smartphones such as the ability to contact employees outside of work hours. The study recommends that smartphones used for work should feature tools to increase productivity such as easier access to information systems. The recommendations further state that work smartphones be focused on increasing flexibility by offering more locations and hours to work because expanded flexibility causes an increase in work-to-life conflict. This study was conducted by faculty at two universities along with a PhD candidate and was published in a peer-reviewed journal. McBride, Deborah L. Distraction Of Clinicians By Smartphones In Hospitals: A Concept  Journal Of Advanced Nursing 71.9 (2015): 2020-2030. Publisher Provided Full Text Searching File. Web. 28 Jan. 2017. This article analyzes the effects of smartphone use by clinicians in medical settings, especially the effects it has on patient care. Smartphones provide easy access to patient information and medical references for doctors and nurses to use for treatment but they also provide a potentially major distraction. A survey of surgical technicians mentioned by the author Pawelec 4 states that half of the respondents admitted to texting during heart-lung bypass procedures and 55% admitted to taking phone calls during surgery. Despite the possible distractions from smartphones it was predicted that smartphones would be used by 90% of clinicians by 2013. It was also shown that clinicians in the emergency department use social media on their smartphones more as patient volume increases, which suggests that they use smartphones as a break from the stressful environment of the emergency room. Even with the benefits that smartphones provide, some hospitals have outright banned smartphone use by clinicians while other hospitals have implemented policies that specifically state how smartphones can be used. These policies were implemented due to a negative effect of electronic distractions on patient safety.
