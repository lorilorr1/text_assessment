Harding 1 Kaamera Harding Brendan Jackson Spring 2017 March 5 th 2017 Project 2 Throughout the years, the issue of captivity has been frequently used among researchers. In the early researchers focused on the social affects captivity has on wild animals. However, the focus of research has shifted from studying the social behaviors of captive animals and moved on to considering how captivity affects biological behaviors. Recent research has shown that captivity not only affects the social behaviors of animals but also their biological behaviors. Over the researchers have discovered different affects that captivity has on animal behavior. Before 2010 captivity was seen as causing changes in the behavior of wild animals. An early study done in 2004, focused on the long-term effects that captivity has on a group of animals. Researchers found that the longer each group was removed from the wild the higher the variation of behavioral traits between generations. More Specifically there was a gradual loss of behaviors across generations ( Mcphee 2004 ). They lost certain reproductive behaviors They also found that when captive animals were reintroduced to the wild they often died due to behavioral deficiencies. After 2010 the switch from the focus on social to biological behaviors began. An Example of this switch would be a study done in 2016 by a group of post graduate students at the Autonomous University of Barcelona in Spain. They discovered that a limited space in certain captive spaces causes an increase in cortisol, a hormone linked to chronic stress ( Harding 2 Salas, et al. 2016 ). According to Marina Salas, the increase in cortisol is linked to increased amounts of aggressive behaviors among animals. So this study was saying the affects that captivity has on animals mutually exclusive but they go hand in hand with each other. The increase of cortisol in animals increases the frequency of aggressive behaviors and vice versa. In continuation, the way researchers study the effects captivity has on wild animals has changed over time. Before 2010 researchers believed captivity caused wild animals to develop behaviors not typical to their naturalistic patterns ( Altman 2005 ). According to JD Altman, the feeding style commonly used with captive lions caused a spike in obesity, inactivity and pacing. Although researchers have strongly supported the idea that captivity has effects on the social behavior of animals, it has also been proven that the biological behaviors of animals are effected to. According to a study conducted by Stacy P Brummer and her associates, the amount of space provided in captive spaces directly effects the opportunity for captive animals to replicate natural biological behaviors of their wild. The found that the animals, in case of the study; coyotes, in larger enclosed spaces exhibited similar heart rates to those found in the wild ( Brummer 2010 ). The research went from studying captive animal developing negative social behaviors to the ability for captive animals to replicate certain biological behaviors natural to their species. Another aspect that has changed with research in captivity is the constraints put on captive animals limits them from participating in natural behaviors. The study looked at why some wild animals thrive in captive spaces and others dissipate ( Clubbs 2003 ). They found that no matter how a captive space attempts to resemble the habitat of the animal occupying it there are still factors that limit its ability to practice certain behaviors such as space and feeding techniques ( Clubbs 2003 ). After 2010 researcher in Japan were looking into how confinements placed on caged carnivores affected their locomotive behaviors ( Kohari 2017 ). According to Harding 3 Daisuke Kohari, the carnivores that were subject to confinement all day were more likely to exhibit abnormal behaviors such as unusual pacing and restlessness. In conclusion, researchers have shifted their areas of research in captivity over periods of time. The research has switched from looking at the change social behaviors to a change biological behaviors and then final to looking at how changes in one effect the other. Over the years there has been increased awareness about the effects of captivity on wild animals. Hence the inception of non-profit organizations like the AZA; Association of Zoos and Aquariums, that require zoos to develop enrichment programs to simulate the natural environment of animals.
