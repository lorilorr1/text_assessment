Garcia De Castro 1 Miguel Garcia De Castro Ms. Poston ENC 1102 027 12 February 2017 The future of marijuana in America Cannabis sativa is a plant that has been used for different purposes throughout history. In the United States, the plant was consumed with recreational and medicinal purposes until 1937 when possession and dealing of the plant was prohibited through the Marijuana Tax Act. This decision has affected the lives of many, as people get thrown to jail on a daily basis for consuming or possessing it. It has been proven that cannabis is non-addictive and that it is basically impossible to overdose on it. Marijuana should be legalized throughout the whole nation, as it has many medical benefits and is less harmful than other legal substances such as alcohol and cigarettes. First off, it is important to understand relevance in the medical field. The plant is capable of treating many diseases, ranking from PTSD to insomnia. The most common use of medical cannabis is to treat muscle and joint pains. Studies show that THC is the chemical compound in marijuana responsible for its pain-relieving effects. Marijuana can be used to treat and prevent the eye disease glaucoma, which increases pressure in the eyeball, damaging the optic nerve and causing loss of vision (Welsh, 23). The plant can also prevent epileptic seizures, as shown in a study conducted by Robert J. DeLorenzo in 2003 where he gave marijuana extract to epileptic rats. Results showed that control seizures by binding to the brain cells responsible for controlling excitability and regulating (DeLorenzo, 12). Many Americans in need of medical marijuana are unable to purchase the drug since it is only legal in Garcia De Castro 2 28 states throughout the country. An example of this is Joshua Lee, a retired Army sergeant who suffers from PTSD, fibromyalgia, and arthritis. He could easily treat his conditions with the help of medical marijuana. However, since Joshua lives in the state of Missouri (where cannabis is still illegal) he is forced to buy a variety of drugs (muscle relaxers, opiates, anti-psychotics, muscle relaxers, among others) to a normal Not only does he need to put up with all the side effects and constant fatigue that taking all those drugs induce on a person, but he also needs to buy 9,828 pills annually to function regularly (Jaeger, 2). It is also important to consider economic impact suffered in the nation after marijuana was legalized in states such as Colorado and Oregon. Studies claim that the black market received approximately 300 billion dollars on marijuana sales from 2000 to 2010 (Cala, 50). However, after the substance got decriminalized in some states, the government began making money from it. state of Colorado made 2.5$ million in sales taxes alone in February 2016. Combined with all marijuana-related taxes, licenses and fees, the state brought in nearly $12.5 million that same month. Studies anticipate that the state makes more than $150 million in total tax dollars by year (Erb, 16). Opposing marijuana legalization is, in most cases, caused by plain ignorance and prejudice. Jeff Sessions, our Attorney General, is a great example of this. Sessions plans to enforce federal weed laws because he thinks America will worsen if marijuana is legalized. However, he has proved on multiple occasions to be ignorant about the effects. During a press conference, Sessions stated that is only slightly less awful than even though there has been absolutely zero deaths from a weed overdose while heroin kills approximately 35,000 people annually in the nation (Williams, 12). Even after being proven that the plant is basically harmless when compared to legal substances such as alcohol and tobacco, cannabis- related crimes still cause thousands of incarcerations in the nation. Eighty eight percent of the Garcia De Castro 3 arrests that occurred between the years 2001 to 2010 were for marijuana possession. In the year 2015, nearly 707,000 people were sent to jail for marijuana-related offenses; roughly one arrest for cannabis every 45 seconds (Wright, 3). These numbers serve as evidence that, while half the country is fighting for legalization, cannabis is far from being accepted in our nation. So, what are we waiting for? Canada is about to become the second country in the world to legalize the consumption of recreational marijuana, while other nations are taking actions to decriminalize the substance. 60% of Americans want recreational marijuana to be legalized (Swift, 3), and one in eight adults living in the country say they currently consume marijuana (McCarthy, 3). Legalizing the substance will only improve our economy and ensure that people can consume the substance without having to worry about the product being synthetic or, worse case scenario, laced with another drug.
