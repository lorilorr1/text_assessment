Garcia 1 Santiago Garcia Kristen Rouisse ENC 1102 29 January 2017 Payment for College Athletes College athletes and their supporters have been protesting against the NCAA, because they feel as if it is unfair that they do not get paid and the NCAA and their colleges get all their money for their hard work in football and basketball and other sports. They believe that they work just as hard as NFL or NBA players, and they are not getting the same treatment as them. If college athletes got paid they would begin to have financial awareness which would give them a head start to adulthood and how they should use their money wisely. (SmartAsset) The problem that many people see regarding whether they should pay the student athletes is that, the athletes already receive many scholarships and other benefits like free tuition and board, and basic needs like their meal plans and is unfair for those students who get amazing grades and cannot be athletes. The whole point of college sports is for the glory and fame and to win, but many believe that paying athletes would ruin the whole idea of that and would instead make the athletes play for the money instead of sportsmanship and other values. It would also be unfair if the student athletes got paid, because some colleges with more funds would pay more for those athletes, and the athletes would most likely go for the college that is paying them more, causing the team with the most money have the best players, and they will not have much competition in the sport, which means they would keep winning and all the funds from winning will keep going to these schools. Another problem with paying athletes is that the schools tend to have Garcia 2 enough money for computers or books for students to use, so instead the money should be used for the education instead of a sport. In regards to whether college athletes should be paid or not, NCAA and organizations like the NFL, NBA, etc., should compromise to find the best possible outcome for the athletes and universities to be satisfied. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is a non-profit organization for student athletes and to remind them of their core values in sports in colleges and universities. The National Collegiate Athletic Association was founded March 31, 1906 by Theodore Roosevelt, in Indianapolis, Indiana. The organization was made in order to protect young people from the dangerous athletics at the time. (Huffington Post) In 1905, football was almost abolished because 18 college and amateur athletes died during games, for which Theodore Roosevelt held two meetings at the white house with 13 football representatives to talk about getting safety equipment for the players. After this, the NCAA was formed to what we know it is today. The National College Athletic core values have been to be a model for athletics and have tons of sportsmanship, culture, leadership, and respect for other players. The National Collegiate Athletic Association stands against paying college athletes, because the whole point of their organization was to be which means that nobody under it can earn money, all the sports in college are under NCAA and they cannot gain money unless winning a championship. The NCAA has made 1 billion dollars a year from merchandise and TV. College athletics make around 12.4 billion dollars in total in a year, and college athletes get none of the money. 96% of the NCAA member schools revenue goes to the colleges and the money is spent for athletic programs, coaches, staff, stadiums, and equipment. (Money Nation) Programs like the NFL and NBA however, are for profit organizations, and believe that college athletes should be paid for their hard work, because they work just as hard and entertain Garcia 3 millions of people just like the professionals. The National Football mission statement is, Engagement is to have a positive impact on values and culture, while promoting the personal and professional growth of players and their families before, during, and beyond their NFL (NFL) The NBA does not have only one specific mission statement, but all the different teams have various similar and different statements to their cause for the game. The National Football League is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams, divided equally between the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference. (AFC) The National Football League was created in 1920 as APFA, other known as the American Professional Football Association, until it was renamed to the NFL in 1922. Just recently in 2016, NFL revenues projected to surpass thirteen billion dollars in just that year, thanks to NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, who negotiated television rights deals as well as enhancing upcoming league income streams. (Forbes) The National Basketball Association, also known as the NBA, was founded on June 6, 1946 in New York City, New York. The NBA is the very famous professional basketball league in North America, and is considered the best professional basketball league in the world. Both of these professional leagues believe that college athletes should be paid for their hard work and effort into their sport, because they are gaining revenue for the NCAA and the universities. Clearly a compromise needs to be made between these organizations in order to satisfy the students, and the universities. All of the organizations and stakeholders want to make sure the student athletes receive a fun experience in college within their sport, and that the universities also get their piece of the pie in the deal they must make in order for them to comply with each other and not cause problems for the colleges having money issues. The purpose of the NCAA was to make sports safe and it was a non-profit organization from the start, but they should start Garcia 4 to advertise and merchandise more in order to gain more revenue so that they can stop being non-profit and making it more fair for the hard working student athletes who are risking their lives and time in playing the sport at their best potential. The NFL and NBA however, must pitch in some of their revenue to help the NCAA pay the universities and colleges and their student athletes. This will make more athletes want to join teams and play better and train more, the students however need to spend more time in the sport than they already do, because they are not on professional level yet, so they will have to wait a few years or get signed by a professional team if they are good enough or if they wanted to join in order to get paid more and have more free time. Sports to athletes is very important and no matter if they get paid or not, they will still put in a lot of work and time to do their best in the game they love so much to play. The NCAA and the professional sports organizations should be able to form a contract in order to be able to complete their goals with one another, since they want the students to be treated fairly and the universities to get revenue for the sports. The sports industry would grow vastly and many young athletes would rise from many different areas with different skills and potential which can be improved if they have the mindset if they are paid to play for their sports teams.
