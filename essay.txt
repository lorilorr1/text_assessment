Due to the willingness of people to stay connected in the Digital Age, the world has witnessed an unprecedented connectivity. Laptops, phones, PCs and even household devices such as TVs and fridges have started to require internet connection to function properly. Together with the comfort this closeness has brought, there is a concern over the vast amount of personal information being spread into the Web. As much as this is useful to FBI and other intelligence agencies to provide security to citizens by allowing them to track the dangerous criminals, it is also as important for people to keep their private information unexposed. Meanwhile, giant technology companies like Apple Inc. also want to ensure its users privacy as much as they can. In other words, it is a clash between privacy and security, which has already become synonymous with a clash between Apple Inc. and FBI. 
As the goal of both parties is to serve the people and protect them, their cooperation without undermining each others mission and priorities would bear the best result since the investigative power of FBI and the technological power of Apple Inc. would be the best tools to fight any type of crime.
